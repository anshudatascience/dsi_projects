# The Ultimate Countdown is drawing to an end and I'd like to detail what we're doing as community for Tuesday's event.

[The Ultimate Countdown](https://preview.redd.it/bi7rc4e9h4k51.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0219fd40eb8ad13f76e185ea708a2dd031b3def)

**What:** GeForce Special Event featuring CEO Jensen Huang

**When:** Tuesday, September 1, 2020 @ 9am PDT. [Click here to see the time in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=GeForce+Special+Event&amp;iso=20200901T09&amp;p1=886&amp;ah=2)

**Where:** [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nvidia) &amp; [Ustream](https://www.ustream.tv/NVIDIA)

**How**: There are multiple ways to join in the fun. See below for details.

* **Discord** \- You can join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/nvidia) and chat about the event live!
* **Subreddit -** We have a couple things planned for the subreddit:
   * **Before The Event - Normal rules apply**. Just a reminder of Rule #8 to discuss specific rumor in the respective rumor thread not a standalone thread.
   * **During The Event -** The mod team will be updating a **Reddit Live thread**. This will be posted and stickied on the subeddit prior to the event.
   * **After The Event -** There will be a stickied **summary Megathread** for discussion.
   * **After The Event -** Something else? :)

**Special Meta Announcement**: Due to the anticipated surge in volume during and after the event, the subreddit will **restrict posting up to 30-45 minutes before and after the event**. This will allow us to update the livethread during the event and finalize the summary Megathread after the event. **You can still view the subreddit and comment on existing thread** during this time. **Once the summary Megathread is up, the restriction on posting will be lifted**. We are striving to have this restriction as short as possible.

# What is rumored

nvidia,"So I sold my 1070 to a friend and he gave me his old 970 meanwhile I buy the new 3080/3090 (who knows how they're gonna be tomorrow).

I used to have a 970 G1 but I had to return because a fan went numb, and the seller had to gave me my money back.

I completely forgot how well the 970 still runs today. Even though I play at 1440p and it hits the 3,5GB limit pretty fast, every game I play runs good enough for my taste.

I repasted it because it ran very hot, now it's louder than my previous 1070, but I can bear with it. GPU Boost 3.0 made the core clock bounce all around depending on the temperature and power target, but with 2.0, it stays where I want to.

For those who cannot afford new GPUs and are stuck with lower tier/series such as the 970: **appreciate your GPU and stick with it until it dies.**

nvidia,"We're consolidating **all** tech support posts and questions into this **monthly** tech support and questions megathread.

It should be noted, r/NVIDIA does not represent NVIDIA in any capacity unless specified. There's also no guarantee NVIDIA even read this subreddit, if you have an issue, criticism or complaint; it's recommended to post it on the official GeForce forum.

**All Tech Support posts that do not include sufficient information will be removed without warning**

Before creating a Tech Support post, please see our additional resources section, it solves a lot of common issues.

TL;DR: **DO: Use the template. DO NOT: ""i have driver issue please help not 60fps!!""**

# For Tech Support Posts

Please use this template below - posts without adequate information will be removed, we can't help you unless you provide adequate information.

**Status:** UNRESOLVED/SOLVED - please update if your issue is resolved

**Computer Type:** State if your computer is a Desktop or Laptop and the brand/model if possible, e.g Desktop, custom built

**GPU:** Provide the model, amount of VRAM and if it has a custom overclock, e.g. GTX 1070, 8GB of VRAM, no overclock

**CPU:** Provide the model and overclock information if possible, e.g. Intel Core i5 6600k, no overclock

**Motherboard:** Provide the model and current BIOS version if possible, e.g. MSI Z170A GAMING M9 ACK, latest BIOS (1.8)

**RAM:** Provide the model and overclock information if possible, e.g. Corsair 8GB (2x4GB) DDR4 2400MHz, XMP enabled, no overclock

**PSU:** Provide the model and its rated wattage and current output if possible, e.g. EVGA 850 BQ, 850W, 70amps on the 12v rail - for laptops you can leave this blank

**Operating System &amp; Version:** State your OS and version, also please state if this is an upgrade or clean install, e.g. Windows 10 build 1607 64bit, upgrade from Windows 8.1

**GPU Drivers:** Provide the current GPU driver installed and if it’s clean install or upgrade, e.g. 376.33, clean install

**Description of Problem:** Provide as much info about the issue as you possibly can, images and videos can be provided as well.

**Troubleshooting:** Please detail all the troubleshooting techniques you’ve tried previously, and if they were successful or not, e.g. tried clean install of GPU drivers, issue still occurs. Please update this as more suggestions come in

# For Question &amp; Answer Post

Additionally, this thread will be used to answer general questions that may not warrant having their own thread -- this could be questions about drivers, prices, builds, what card is the best, is this overclock good etc…

Please don't downvote questions for the sake of helping others. We will also sort the post randomly so every question can be seen and answered.

If you don't have any tech support issues or questions, please contribute to the community by answering questions.

So, I was hoping the announcement of new GPUs might bring prices for the 1660 Super down. I'm currently running a GTX 960, and I wanted something that might last a few years, but I can't really break the bank right now to purchase something that doesn't fit a dual-screen 1080p usage case...

I have a Cooler Master HAF 932 that I love because it uses huge fans (240mm fan on top!). They spin slower than small fans, but move more air and stay quieter. The case is designed for proper airflow.

I've got space in my desk for a case up to 23 inches tall and 10 1/2 inches wide.

I'm looking for a similiar case with large fans and designed for good airflow. I also need a large case to make sure I can fit in a long video card. I'm going with a RTX 3080, but I'm sure several enthusiasts here might have to consider new cases with the size of these cards.

nvidia,"Greetings!

So I have this issue here, or I'm not sure if it is one. My video card is working quite intensely, even with minimum load. For instance, today I'm playing Black Mesa on Steam, which is basically Half Life 2 type of graphics, and this videocard should not heat up to 82 ℃. It doesn't go above 83, and doesn't go lower than 75 during loading or pauses. But still, I played like Witcher 3 on ultra settings at I can understand it going up to 82, but not when I'm playing such basic games. How can I perhaps make it better so it doesn't get worn out like this? Already using EVGA PrecisionX, where I set the curve and all that, but still, it is just strange to me  that it has to work so hard.

Looking to the 3000 series as a step 1 of my upgrade of my aging pc.

I've got a i5-4690k, 16gb ram, 970gtx.

Thinking about upgrading to either a 3070 or 3080 depending on price performance ratio. I suspect I'll be CPU and PCI express 3 limited, but hopefully will get a nice performance boost. Then in a few months will look to build a new pc with rizen and a new MB (with pci express 4), and move my new RTX over to that machine.

Am I totally crazy for doing this? Or is this a good idea?

My long term plan is to get into VR, and be able to play games without chugging along on FPS. I do have a 4k monitor so being able to game at that res would be a plus. Obviously I know a graphics card upgrade alone won't fix all the issues, especially in CPU heavy games, but want to spread out the cost of a new build.

Also is there really going to be a big difference between the 3070 and the 3080? Bearing in mind my 970 was £300, I'm having a bit of a shock at the massive increase in prices since then.

nvidia,"Hi,

This is my issue.

I recently replaced the graphics card in my almost 2 year old pc, from a MSI GTX 1060 Gaming X to a MSI 2060 Gaming Z.  I have also followed all procedures that I could find to overclock it to be still stable.  I am NOT much of a gamer, and 1080p is the max I'm foreseeing playing for any game in the near future, perhaps always.  I do NOT play FPS games, but this is the main reason I upgraded the card.

I am a HUGE computer golf fan, and highly anticipated the arrival of PGA Tour 2K21, and even purchased it prior to release (Last Friday).  I didn't get a chance to test the game out until today, and here are my observations.

It would seem, from all that I have read, that I can play any current game on ultra settings in 1080p with this gpu.  But, here are my findings.

First off, I chose ultra for the standard settings.  In the training sessions, when the ball is flying, or bouncing on the ground, I can see, and please forgive the fact that I do not know the proper terminology, light streaks come across the screen, usually in a diagonal fashion, in those instances.

I have tried many things before having to go to work today to correct this.

First off, I changed settings from ultra to something lower, for every available setting.  Did not fix the issue.  Also, I have the option of syncing to 144k, or 70K, or no syncing, and none of these settings seem to fix the issue, albeit, some do, to a small degree, but it is still noticeable.

The main setting, one admittedly I don't really understand, is the AA setting.  There are I think 5 or 6 choices, from none, faa, 3 different levels of  saa, and taa.  Currently I have it set to taa, which gives the least amount of those ""lines"", which I will refer to as sprites, as that is what it reminds me of.

So, my question basically is, how do I get rid of this effect?  I am not schooled in AA at all, if that is even what the issue is.  Also, there are a TON of settings one can make via the nvidia control panel, and I hesitate to start f\*\*\*\*\*g around without knowing what I am doing.

Perhaps my OC is too great; again, I have no clue...this is new territory for me.

I'm sure somebody here knows exactly what I am talking about, but I'm explaining it poorly.

My monitor has a max refresh rate of 144, and it's an ips monotor, 24"".  Like I said, I am NOT a gamer really, but I don't like visual annoyances.  It is NOT a G-Sync monitor as well, and G-Sync is NOT enabled in the nvidia settings.

Can all of you educated in graphics please explain to me what I am seeing, why I am seeing it, and how to rid myself of it?

nvidia,"**TL;DR at bottom.**

My question stems from the recent news that the 3080 will come in 10GB and 20GB VRAM variants.

My first GPU ever back in 2012 was a gtx 660 with 2GB VRAM. I upgraded last year to a GTX 1660 with 6GB VRAM as Monster Hunter World needed at least 4GB I think to use HD textures (lovely btw, worth it!).

I saw the comments and people seem annoyed by both the 1GB reduction from a 1080ti and also the stark division between the two.

Now I'm not someone who is going to buy the 3080, I honestly am hoping more for a 3060/ti that has the performance of a 2070/S at a cheaper price point than currently.

My question more has to do with VRAM usage on newer games at the 1080p resolution.

Is more VRAM going to be required in general regardless of resolution?

I don't really get how VRAM scalability works throughout the advancement of technology, is it similar to how more games require more real CPU cores as games get more advanced?

Or is VRAM something that is more focused on resolutions? I saw most complaints coming from people gaming at 1440p/4K.

**TL;DR: Will newer games at 1080p 60+fps require more VRAM just like newer games at 1080p 60+fps require more CPU cores?**

I have seen a lot of posts saying pascal was 1.094v but not much on Turing. I also saw somebody say on here nvida is on the record saying anything under 1.064v I haven’t been able to confirm that. I also saw Nvidia say on a game or nexus interview turning the voltage slider up to 100% could reduce lifespan to one year but I hope that’s just them covering their butt. Some of you may recognize me from my other posts but a quick recap: I have an aorus 2070 super. I didn’t have the luck I had hoped manually overclocking with offsets, I can get  +25 core at 2010mhz and +800memory before I start to get errors on OCCT 3D test. I found better results using the voltage frequency curve. My card runs mostly 1.050 stock and there I can turn it to 2070mhz and +800memory and not really worry sense that is what it does normally. However I can get up to 2100mhz at about 1.068v , and Maybe more but I stop there until I found out what safe long-term voltage is. I understand this varies card to card and model to model but I was looking for a general safe consensus. I also don’t get errors in OCCT when I use the curve this way , not really sure why but I think it has to do with I hit power limits instantly in that test which drops the voltage no matter what down to around 900 making higher clocks unstable. I guess when I only changed one point on the voltage frequency curve if I can’t do that it just goes back to what it normally does, but I’m no expert maybe you’ll know ? It may be worth mentioning to that one of the selling points if this car was “ Built for Extreme Overclocking 12+2 Power Phases” As opposed to nvidia 8+2.

nvidia,"Do you think that 4k will be the new 1440p? The resolution that most people target on the mid to high end with new hardware? Is 4k something you care about at all, and is it even in your list of reasons to upgrade?  


**My thoughts:** 

4k was a HUGE jump from 1440p in terms of processing power needed, and I don't feel like a card has done justice to 4k yet, and also until now we haven't had HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.0 to bridge the gap anyway. Now we've got TVs like LG C9/Cx that do 4k 120 hz with 40-120 fps VRR range with gsync certification, and I'm sure DP2.0 monitors are around the corner. DLSS 3.0 will likely yield even better perf than DLSS 2.0 with hopefully easier integration for developers (and I'm hoping the same TAA vector data and so forth can be used for AMD cards bc it would lead to increased adoption).   


I think that this is probably the gen where high end cards will be able to create 4k content at comfortably higher than 60 fps ranges (for me this would be say 75+ for 3080, 90+ for 3090 but obviously just fun pure speculation) on titles that implement DLSS 3.0, even modern games.   


If it doesn't happen, I'll be fine staying at 1440p...but I also probably will just stick with my 2080 FE for another year or two and stick with 1440p gaming. I don't see the point in upgrading to the 30 series unless this happens. I don't want to play in 4k at 60 fps, and I can already play pretty much any game at high to ultra settings at 1440p at a comfortable FPS range.  


I care about 4k only because I'm going to drop $$$ on a 65 inch OLED 4K tv when the PS5 drops and I plan also running an HDMI cable to that TV and PC gaming from a couch at times. Non native content on a 4k screen won't look ideal, and the larger screen will show off more jaggies than my 27 inch computer monitor does at 1440p. PS5 will probably make me get used to 4k as the standard, but I'm also NOT going to go out and buy a 3090, they are just too damn expensive. 3080 is probably going to be more justifiable. It's my hope that the 3080 will be a 4k champ and if so I'll probably buy one.",What are your expectations/hopes for 4k performance this next gen?

nvidia,"Some rumors suggested that the new RTX would have a separate co-processor that would be used to accelerate ray-tracing. But what if it was actually controller for storing/recovering compressed data from RAM and disk?  

Microsoft promises that using their [**Sampler Feedback Streaming** from the Velocity Architecture](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/14/a-closer-look-at-xbox-velocity-architecture/) they can make the memory use in Xbox Series X 2.5x more efficient, meaning, for example, that 25 GB of texture data could be stored in 10GB of the main memory + 15 GB of the SSD.

Nvidia can't afford to expect every single of their graphics cards owner will have a ultra-fast SSD, but they sure can offload that extra memory to RAM. So that rumored co-processor could be using RAM to do what the new consoles will do. 

Additionally, besides compressing and moving the data with the new co-processor, Nvidia can use machine learning techniques (accelerated by the tensor cores) to achieve similar results to those of Xbox's Sample Feedback Streaming, making sure only the data that is less probable to be used will be stored in RAM/disk.",Could Nvidia be developing a solution akin to the new consoles data compression to launch with RTX 3000 series?,rumor suggest new rtx would separ co processor would use acceler ray trace actual control store recov compress data ram disk microsoft promis use sampler feedback stream veloc architectur news xbox en us closer look xbox veloc architectur make memori use xbox seri x x effici mean exampl gb textur data could store gb main memori gb ssd afford expect everi singl graphic card owner ultra fast ssd sure offload extra memori ram rumor co processor could use ram new consol addit besid compress move data new co processor use machin learn techniqu acceler tensor core achiev similar result xbox sampl feedback stream make sure data less probabl use store ram disk could develop solut akin new consol data compress launch rtx seri

nvidia,"So this has been bothering me for the last few weeks seeing people moan about card pricing. ""BuT tHeY hAvE 50% MaRgInZ!""

Fools. The gross profit/margin reported on the quarterly reports exclude R&amp;D costs. Therefore this gross profit/margin you are referencing is literally just the cost of parts/assembly versus the cost to sell.

I am sure we all know that in order for Nvidia to improve technology, and therefore their products, they MUST spend money for R&amp;D. If you stop R&amp;D you effectively have no company in a couple years as your products are dated. You like RTX? DLSS? etc? Yeah, thats R&amp;D folks.

So yes, July 2020 GM was 58% (note this is all lines of business/products). However, if you factor in R&amp;D costs, and SG&amp;A (required spending to operate the company), you end up with income from operations of 17%. This represents what it takes for Nvidia to operate as a company, and to do the things that we all want them to do.

""BuT 17% iS sTiLl ToO hIgH!!!""

I agree, their cards are more pricey than they have to be. So what would bring them to a more typical operating income margin? A 10% drop in selling price across all lines would bring their operating income to 7.5%, from 17%, all else being equal. A 15% drop in prices would bring them down to 2%.

So, for your top cards thats about what, $100-150 ""overpriced"" depending on what you deem a reasonable operating income is for a company. Lower end cards maybe $50-75.

However, rather than use logic and reason, people seem to like to cry and say WELL THE OLD TOP END CARDS USED TO BE $600!!!! Hey friend, listen, things change, things get more expensive. It gets harder and harder to iterate over time, which takes more money, to deliver those wonderful generation on generation gains you are all thirsty for. Its there in black and white... for Nvidia to be somewhat profitable they cant drop prices like ""ThE oLd DaYs"". Understand it. Live with it. Expect this to continue if you want Nvidia to keep delivering newer tech/features.

TLDR: With some competition can we see that 10-15% off of prices? Sure. But to expect prices to halve simply because thats where they were priced before makes no sense at all and is not based in any reality whatsoever.

I am not a unique man. I have held onto my 980 as if it were my first child for the past 6 years. But alas, the time has come and so I require knowledge from those wiser than myself.

I know that people have been saying that the AIB cards are likely to release at the same time as the FE this generation, but where exactly will these be sold? For example, if EVGA releases their stock on launch day will it only be on the EVGA website or would they also be available on Amazon?

I have class the morning of the launch and want to make sure I am giving myself the best advantage going into this. (Unique I know)

nvidia,"Since March of this year the rumor mill has stated with confidence that the 3000 series consumer cards will be Samsung 8nm. 

I've researched this issue for a few days now and have some general thoughts I'd like others to discuss or correct:

1. 8nm LPP/LPU is 2x+ more dense than Turing's enhanced 12nm. 

2. 8nm LPP is from 2017! LPU is from mid-2018. LPP is meant for cheap mobile SOCs. LPU is for high frequency chips. There are few confirmed specs on LPU though. 

3. Nvidia and TSMC were quite adamant that they would continue being ""primary partners"" as of late 2019. GA-100 was on 7nm. Making most of Ampere on Sammy 8nm is surprising after these announcements and the fact 7nm has high yields. 

In conclusion, however, the FE cards are THICC and long. This initially supports 8nm and high clocks. Yet 8nm LPU essentially = TSMC 7nm HPC in density.

nvidia,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking: ""The GT 1030 is shit, why would anyone want it to live on??"" Or: ""It's shit for gaming, it will be completely redundant in a few years"" 

If you think like that about the card then you are viewing it wrong imo. While it isn't the most powerful card and for just $40NZD more you can get almost twice the performance in a GTX 1050ti, it has a very niche market which it caters to near perfectly as of now.

Here are some pros:

- It is a single slot card, great for prebuilt, small form factor office PCs 

- It has a very low power draw of ~30W, which means that it will run on pretty much any power supply

- It runs esports titles like Rocket League, CSGO, League of Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite, R6 etc. Perfectly smooth well over 60fps on low settings, and while it struggles on games like Red Dead and Warzone even at 720p, if you only want to play the esports titles, it's all you need if you only have a 90, 75 or 60 hz monitor.

- It's reasonably quiet

- They can be found for $50 in some places, which is very affordable if you just want to enter into gaming with a $100 prebuilt from the early 2010s, which often pack a 3-4th gen i5 or even an i7 CPU.

So with all that considered, I think that Nvidia could make a successor to this card with a decent jump over this one and hit a real sweet spot in the market and sell a decent lot of these cards to the lower end market. While it would be a challenge to get all the elements such as low power draw, a single slot low profile design etc that make the GT 1030 such a niche card into a decently powerful successor that can carry on the legacy and uses for the 1030, I believe that it could make a very interesting case for a new card design into the future, despite being useless to the higher end hardcore market of PC gamers.

I'm thinking to get the HP Omen 2020 version. It has an I7 10750H and an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. It's costing 1650~$. But there is also the Acer Nitro 5 with again an I7 10750H and a GTX 1660 TI. The Acer is 330 dolars more cheaper.

I believe there is something like an max of a %15-20 performance difference between the RTX 2070 Super Max-Q and GTX 1660 TI. Which is not much if we think it's more expensive. But I'm still not sure about it. 

I don't want the RTX 2060,I don't believe it's worth that too. Because it's not powerful enough to take the benefits of RTX.

I already knew power management is experimental and so I dived down the rabbit hole on how to set it up since a little orange LED (which is blue if the GPU is powered off) shows me the dGPU is always on.

By looking up the official [read me](https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/450.57/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html) about power management it confirmed why my GPU is always on:

&gt;This feature is available only when the following conditions are satisfied:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This feature is supported only on notebooks.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This feature requires system hardware as well as ACPI support (ACPI ""\_PR0"" and ""\_PR3"" methods are needed to control PCIe power). The necessary hardware and ACPI support was first added in Intel Coffeelake chipset series. Hence, this feature is supported from Intel Coffeelake chipset series.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This feature requires a Turing or newer GPU.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This feature is supported with Linux kernel versions 4.18 and newer. With older kernel versions, it may not work as intended.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- This feature is supported when Linux kernel defines CONFIG\_PM (CONFIG\_PM=y). Typically, if the system supports S3 (suspend-to-RAM), then CONFIG\_PM would be defined.

My Hardware does not match any of the above requirements:

* Kepler GPU GK208M (GT 730M)
* Intel i5-3230M (Coffelake is 8th gen)

My question is why are these requirements requirements?

Since tools like [bbswitch](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch) can already turn off the dGPU which works on my configuration since I used Prime Manager (aka `prime-select intel` or `prime-select nvidia`) to toggle GPUs before.

But was sick of og out and log in each time I change the GPU and that everthing is then running on the same GPU and I could not make use of both GPUs.

PRIME Offloading is awesome and solves all my issues except of the newly introduced Power Management thing I'd like to know more about.

Since bbswitch also uses ACPI calls to turn the dGPU off or on I assume some sort of ACPI power management is available.

Also on Windows the whole thing works too so I am pretty confused why there are special hardware requirements while other systems can do it on the same hardware while the Linux driver don't?

Edit: Also considering that Nouveau can at least turn the dGPU on and off. I am just not using Nouveau because it can not reclock the gpu beyond performance level 0.

For those who may suggest using bbswitch then to circumvent this, I already tried this but using bbswitch will cause the whole PRIME thing  to miss the NVidia driver since it seems not to be loaded if bbswitch is installed and running.

My currents hard and software configuration:

* CPU: Intel i5-3230M
* dGPU: GT 730M (Kepler GK208M) Driver: 450.57
* iGPU: HD Graphics 4000 (IVB GT2)
* OS: openSUSE Tumbleweed (Kernel: 5.8.0)

Feel free to get very nerdy and technical to answer this question I really like to know and understand why this is the case.

I've read online a variety of different solutions to this, with some suggesting different adapters such as USB-C to DP, while some suggest a monitor that supports HDMI at 144hz. I was hoping for some more specific advice though. For example, if I get the BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P then can someone recommend a specific adapter that would work at getting 144hz from it as a third monitor. At the same time, if you recommend going the HDMI route for 144hz, could you recommend a 144hz monitor that supports HDMI at 144hz that is within the same price range as the BenQ ZOWIE XL2411P.

nvidia," Hi everyone,

So I bought a pre-built from NZXT last year, and long story short, I don't think I will ever look for a pre-built again.

That being said, I had to RMA my build and my GPU was replaced with an MSI 2070 Super Ventus OC, which I honestly hate. The fans seem to always be blowing at a high speed/loud volume, yet the card doesn't have a low temp for the amount of work the fans seem to be doing. I have been trying to ignore it, but recently, I downloaded and started playing the free trial of FFXIV. The fans seemed to be even louder than before, and I even tried lowering my settings to help, but nothing worked.

So I have been in contact with NZXT to potentially send me a new card, but the 'replacements' are still either a downgrade or a card that there isn't much information about and I am not looking to take the chance really. I wanted to see if anyone would be able to give me some insight on what to do/how to undervolt my GPU and if it would even give me the results that I am looking for. Basically, I just want the fans to be a bit more quiet and the temperatures to be okay. Would undervolting help with this?

I am thinking of just getting a 30 series (either a 3060 or 3070) when they come out, hopefully a card from Nvidia directly. But until then, I wanted to see if undervolting would help until that happens?

Basically long story short, I am getting a gaming laptop, I am not a hardcore gamer but would like a powerful enough machine to last me a fair bit infuse (and the off chance i get addicted to a game like Skyrim etc)

I have a choice between a few laptops but one thing I still don’t get is the star GPU wording and naming.
 You’ve got the RTX 2070 maxQ and RTX2070 mobile...

The prices are different and they are supposed to be the same card albeit I guess the max Q is more “energy efficient” but performance it looks like RTX2070 is better.

Now I don’t get why they released a Max Q version with a higher price tag and less performance.

Can someone explain to a none tech savvy person like me what’s going on exactly? I mean I might as well get the cheaper 2070 if it’s going to perform better but does MaxQ efficiency make it better long term and less “heat”

## CEO Comments

&gt;“Adoption of NVIDIA computing is accelerating, driving record revenue and exceptional growth,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Growth in GeForce gaming accelerated as gamers increasingly immerse themselves in realistic virtual worlds created by NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our new Ampere GPU architecture is sprinting out of the blocks, with the world’s top cloud service providers and server makers moving quickly to offer NVIDIA accelerated computing. Mellanox grew sharply, driven by the need for high-speed networking in cloud data centers to scale-out AI services. And Mercedes-Benz’s partnership with NVIDIA to power its next-generation fleet of luxury cars -- from the computer to the AI software, and from the cloud to the car -- is transformative.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Despite the pandemic’s impact on our professional visualization and automotive platforms, we are well positioned to grow, as gaming, AI, cloud computing and autonomous machines drive the next industrial revolution around the world,” he said.

nvidia,"Hello everyone,

A few months ago I bought an RTX 2070. I didn't take a look at the out ports it had, and now I'm stuck with 1x HDMI, 1xDP and 1xDVI-D, which I think is outrageous for such a recent card, but it's my fault for not checking.

My Oculus Rift S is plugged into the DP Port and my monitor on the HDMI port.

I want to buy a new, 144hz monitor that only has HDMI &amp; DP Out. It doesn't say if the monitor has HDMI 2.0, so my only way of having 144hz would be to use the DP Port.

I don't want to have to unplug my monitor to plug my Rift S everytime I want to play in VR, so is it possible for a DP in to DVI-D Out cable to support 144hz ?

TL;DR : want a 144hz monitor but there's only 1 DP port on my RTX2070 and it's already taken by my VR headset. Can I plug the monitor on my DVI-D port with a DP-in to DVI-D Out cable and get the 144hz or will I still be capped at 60 ?

nvidia," Last week I bought an MSI Gaming X 2060S (on sale for $579.00 Canadian), which is sitting in my living room waiting to be part of my first build. However, after reading a lot more about the next gen Nvidia GPUs, I'm more tempted to wait and see what will be available in the coming months. The problem is, the 2060S has to be returned in a few days if I want a full refund. Some points:

\- I want to play titles like Cyberpunk, but am not picky about frame rates (60fps is fine for me).

\- the majority of my time is spent editing music and videos in Divinci, which uses the GPU.

I've given myself three options:

1. Keep the 2060S, use it until something next gen and in my price point is available/well reviewed etc., and sell the 2060S a year+ down the road if I'm still keen on upgrading. Or, I may find the 2060S more than adequate long term.
2. Return the 2060S, and buy a more affordable GPU like the 1660 ($300.00 CAD) to hold me over until a next gen Nvidia in my wheelhouse (3060/70). Then sell the GPU for less of a loss possibly?
3. Return the 2060S and wait for the Nvidia launch. If it's worth waiting a couple months for a new 3070 for example, do that. If it's going to be a long wait, buy a 2060S possibly at a discounted price (or risk it being unavailable?).

My gut tells me the 2060S is more than enough for my needs, and I'm getting wrapped up in tech hype. But it also tells me I'm paying too much for a card that will soon be replaced...

nvidia,"Hey guys, on Christmas 2017 I wanted to switch from my older bulky 15"" gaming IdeaPad laptop to something light, compact and yet powerful. Intel has just freshly introduced **4-core 8th gen Kaby Lake R** processors for ultrabooks (up until then only 2-core proc.) and Nvidia also updated their GPUs to be more than twice (sometimes 3x) as power efficient withe their **14nm Pascal MX150** (big jump from previous 28nm Maxwell). The 13"" ultrabook world has experienced a huge revolution and I decided to buy **Lenovo Ideapad 320S-13IKB** for only $1000, great laptop even today, almost 3 yeas later. Perfect display comparable to macbooks, plenty of performance for an ultrabook, yet light, thin, quiet and cold, the only 2 downsides were shorter battery life - 4 hours max for light work, and a bit choked performance by Lenovo compared laptops with the same hardware (about +-15%) in favor of silent fans and low temperatures.

But today the performance is somewhat limiting, so I decided to boost things up. The newest bios allowes to switch off processor's default 15W power throttling, which lets it run at full boost 3.4GHz indefinitely. The only problem is the cooling is not enough and after a minute of Cinebench it reaches 95°C and thermal throttles. Even in idle the temps are around 50°C. Not sure if the heatpipe is somehow faulty, or the heatsink is just too small. I even repasted everything with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and undervolted by -100mV in Intel Extreme Tuning Utility but the processor is still reaching 95°C. But it is only in benchmarks, under real load the temps are around 80°C. By this I gained 100 point in **Cinebench R15 (426-&gt;526)** even though at the end it thermal throttled. But some laptops reach up to 750 with the same CPU, and I am baffled how.

EDIT: I actually took off the back cover and checked temperatures manually, and actually the heatpipe is quite hot on both the CPU and GPU (but not super got, my finged didnt get burner, which means the heatpipe is around 60-70°C), but actually the problem is that the heatpipe is very long, CPU and GPU is in one corner and the heatsink in the other corner, and I can actually keep my finger on the opposite end of the heatpipe, so the problem is basically conductivity and poor disipation).

The next in line to Boost was the GPU. Unfortunately Lenovo put the 10W variant into this laptop instead the 25W, so we are limited by the power throttling. Temps stay under 70°C. This GPU is overclocker's wet dream. The default core frequency is 937-1037MHz and the GDDR5 memory runs at 5000MHz. I managed to undervolt it so much using Asus Tweak II (really the best tool, other tools like MSI afterburner cap memory at 7000MHz), that at the firm 10W ceiling I managed to get the **core to run at 1300-1400MHz** (oscilating mostly around 1338MHz) and the **memory to 7500MHz**!!! And the memory is not even that unusual, GDDR5 memories can reach even over 8000MHz quite often. For reference the core curve was set like this (as you can see the voltage was **only 750-850mV** at this crazy frequency).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall these result are crazy in my opinion. **Almost +50% in gaming performance and +25% in CPU performance.** This laptop has impressed me even more, it is definitelly not an old man, even compared to today's $1000 ultrabooks. So if you have similar hardware and you could use some extra performance, definitely go for it! The MX250 is basically the same gpu, it should have similar performance and overcloking potential compared to MX150.

I was using the latest drivers for everything available now in the middle of August 2020 running on updated Windows 10.

PS: If you run into an issue where the nvidia MX150 GPU willfully **power throttles at 5-6W** TDP instead of going all the way to 10W, let me know, I had this annoying problem and found a solution.

nvidia," 

TL;DR Used OC scanner, saw high temps after reverting OC, back to stock ( temp. compared to first week I initially built the machine) worried, bought paste, repasted GPU, VRAM thermal pad got messed up, replaced VRAM thermal pad, temps didn't revert to DAY 1 but 3c decrease, tonight temps are high again. Is my card just hot and I have to live with it or did I take a wrong turn and need to fix something.

Hey everyone!  
In June I completed a new edit/gaming rig, first high performance build in 10 years. (Mostly building consumer desktops for friends and family in the past). I've encountered a bit of weirdness with my June build and want to put what I've been encountering out there to see if this is a problem or I'm being a worry wort.  
The build: NZXT 510, Corsair Gold 650w, 2TB Baracuda HDD, 500GB M.2 NVME SSD, MSI B450 Tomahawk Max, 2x 8GB Corsair Vengeance @ 3600, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, be quiet dark rock slim cooler, Gigabyte Geforce RTx 2070 8gb 2x fan. I added two noctua front intake fans in conjunction with the NZXT stock top and rear exhaust fans.  
I'm running on one 1080p monitor (display port) and about once a week move to a 1440p monitor for 2 to 3 hours.

A few weeks ago I was testing Overclock settings with the OC scanner in MSI afterburner. I wanted to make sure everything could return to normal so I reverted the settings to stock. After reverting, I noticed the idle temp was higher than when I first bought the card. It was idling (and currently) at 44-45c. This is a 6-8c increase from the first 3 weeks of operation.  
To try and curb the temp increase I acquired some Cyronaught from Thermal Grizzly. While re-pasting the GPU I gunked up a VRAM thermal pad which I replaced with some blue VRAM thermal pads I had on hand. I saw a 3c decrease after rebuilding GPu. Today temps were high again.  
Before the initial change under load the GPU would reach 73-76c  
now under load the GPU hovers around 80-82c (MSi afterburner temp limit set at 81c)

I run an aggressive fan curve about 60% gpu fan speed at 52c and up to 75% at 70c.  
At idle afterburner reads: GPU clock 1410mhz, 7000mhz memclock, voltage 762mv, 45c

So thats where my query lies. I know the NZXT 510 isn't the greatest at taking air in, even with the side glass panel off the temps never drop below 43c.  
I know (now) that the Gigabyte 2070 2x fan is the less desirable model, and some say Gigabyte makes sub-par equipment.  
So did I just flub up and buy a GPU that likes to stay toasty? Or did I cause some problem through an attempted OC and reverting to stock then by re-pasting the card. Is the stock boost associated with the card heating up the GPU too quickly? I'm at a loss.

Any advice is helpful!

Been playing around with MSI afterburner and got a decent clock that gets through the entire Unigine benchmark.

Currently  my core clock is +110 and memory clock +1100. Top right corner says  Coreclock at 2280 and MHZ at 8100. Is is safe to be running my card like  this?

Gonna do some game testing  on Monster Hunter World / BF1 later today/tomorrow to see if it's truely  stable. Game crashed after 15 minutes of play at +1100 mhz. GPU temps  were hitting 80-86c. That's the highest i've seen my card go. Dropped  down to +900mhz and it ran smoothly for 20 minutes with max temp at 79c.

Building a new rig specifically for Flight Simulator 2020, Z490 i9-10900KF, 32GB DDR4000 and as for graphic cards, well, waiting on RTX3080.

I initially wanted to run this on 3 monitors at 4K, but the conclusion to my research is that it is likely not feasible, at least not with one card (but probably not with 2 either). Apparently, people with a 2080 struggle to run one 4K monitor at acceptable fps with all settings maxed out.

Just wanted to get confirmation and insights from the community, in case I missed something, and also wondering if running 3 monitors at 2K on a 2080Ti is likely to get me in a 60fps neighborhood? I know it depends largely on FS2020, but curious if it has been done with other games as a reference point (or if 2 cards in SLI are needed).

# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are.So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build for May 2019 Update (Version 1903). If you are on the older version/build (e.g. Version 1507/Build 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

# Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.",Game Ready Driver 452.06 FAQ/Discussion,game readi driver releas new featur fix driver game readi new

nvidia,"So I'm in a dilemma.

I have a 1070 at the moment and it does its job. I have a 4K 144hz screen and the 1070 can get me decent frames for it at 1080p.. but I would prefer more. There are noticable visual drops for me in games like COD: Warzone when running around with 70fps. Games like CS:GO and Valorant run perfectly. Some open world games suffer quite a bit and drop into the 50's and 40's in places depending on the game (Assassin's Creed Odyssey was particularly bad here in parts). Red Dead Redemption 2 for example sits not far above 60fps but dips into the low 50's high 40's in parts.

I'm happy staying at 1080p .. especially given \_most\_ of the games I play are competitive and I'd rather pull \_more\_ frames than less in those. However I'm concious of games like Cyberpunk 2077 that will be coming out later in the year (and another Assassin's Creed game) and I'd like to experience those with as little frame dipping as possible. So again, I'd probably just play those at 1080p as well.

When should I upgrade? I think a 2080 at 1080p would give me HUGE performance boosts would it not? I keep seeing articles everywhere saying ""don't upgrade now because the 30xx series is on its way soon"" ...

So my question is basically two-fold. Firstly, would a 2080 give me a huge perf boost at 1080p? Should I wait for the next gen or just jump into the 20xx series now because the perf gain for my needs will be minimal?",When to upgrade and is it worth it for me,dilemma moment job k hz screen get decent frame p would prefer notic visual drop game like cod warzon run around fp game like cs go valor run perfectli open world game suffer quit bit drop place depend game assassin creed odyssey particularli bad part red dead redempt exampl sit far fp dip low high part happi stay p especi given game play competit rather pull frame less howev conciou game like cyberpunk come later year anoth assassin creed game like experi littl frame dip possibl probabl play p well upgrad think p would give huge perform boost would keep see articl everywher say upgrad xx seri way soon question basic two fold firstli would give huge perf boost p wait next gen jump xx seri perf gain need minim upgrad worth

When I bought my PC, I bought it pre-built (emergency buy since my laptop died) and upgraded components in it (RAM and GPU to 32 GB at 2666 MHz and an RTX 2070 with a few extra SSDs and HDDs).  My CPU is an i7-8700 (no K, F, or KF included) and I have noticed there are significant frame drops when Ray Tracing.  Of course the RTX 2070 is built for Ray Tracing, and I checked to make sure the game I was playing wasn't too taxing on the GPU (no reports online of any issues at max settings, and I am using GeForce's recommended) so I believe it is the CPU to some degree.  The problem is that everywhere I check, there isn't a good comparison of how an i7-8700 runs with an RTX 2070, or if one is limiting the other.  I don't know a whole lot about CPU and GPU interaction, so before I spend a pretty penny on a new CPU, Motherboard, and RAM, I was wondering if anyone knows if the i7-8700 can handle the RTX 2070 and future cards.","Is my CPU limiting my gaming currently, and will it do so with the new GPUs?",saw similar post figur would ask similar slightli differ question bought pc bought pre built emerg buy sinc laptop die upgrad compon ram gb mhz rtx extra ssd hdd k f kf includ notic signific frame drop ray trace cours rtx built ray trace check make sure game play tax report onlin issu max set use geforc recommend believ degre problem everywher check good comparison run rtx one limit know whole lot interact spend pretti penni new motherboard ram wonder anyon know handl rtx futur card limit game current new gpu

nvidia,"Hi all. I've been debating how I want to blow my money recently, and I realized that since I play a lot of competitive OW at a masters/GM level, I may want to invest in a 240hz+ monitor. However, I already play on a 165hz panel that is 1440p, and simply cannot convince myself to spend so much on the new 1440p 240hz panels that samsung/others are making since I think the max I could get out of my current monitor would be 350 dollars. Then, I came across this study from NVIDIA:  [https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2019-11\_Latency-of-30/FPS\_Tasks\_sa2019\_AuthorVersion.pdf](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2019-11_Latency-of-30/FPS_Tasks_sa2019_AuthorVersion.pdf)   


(I'm actually quite surprised I haven't seen this discussed more)

Now, correct me if I am wrong, but does this imply reducing my latency through increasing fps is way more important, and that refresh rate shouldn't help me much at all? I have a tough time drawing a conclusion because it is hard to tell how much of this testing has to do with reaction (which honestly happens quite a bit in OW). Now, I already have 245 fps as a 1% low in OW (maybe .1%), so I really am not struggling for frames, but I am looking forward to upcoming games that AREN'T OW, such as Cyberpunk, Halo, etc. so selling my 2080 for a solid chunk of cash and getting a 3080 for a net loss of 250 and really smooth AAA game experience sounds nice. But the question is, is that nicer than going to 240hz on the game I play the most? Do keep in mind if I did get a 240, I would go 1440p but play OW at 1080p render scale because 1440p is so much better for other games (that is, unless someone knows of a way to switch which monitor is center on the fly, because then I would go the dual monitor route and buy a cheaper 1080p 240hz).  


Bottom line is, are 240hz monitors even worth it? My friend swears by one, describing that ugly feeling when I go from 165 to 60 happens in a similar fashion to him when he goes to 144. But it is hard for me to picture spending 400+ to get 240 and 1440p or a setup that can properly switch main monitors easily, when I could spend under 250 to upgrade from a 2080 to a 3080 and maximize CP2077  (and other games) for my current monitor. If anyone has gone from 144 to 240, please let me know of your experience.","A study by NVIDIA, and should I upgrade my GPU or monitor?",hi debat want blow money recent realiz sinc play lot competit ow master gm level may want invest hz monitor howev alreadi play hz panel p simpli cannot convinc spend much new p hz panel samsung other make sinc think max could get current monitor would dollar came across studi research site default file pub latenc fp task sa authorvers pdf research site default file pub latenc fp task sa authorvers pdf actual quit surpris seen discuss correct wrong impli reduc latenc increas fp way import refresh rate help much tough time draw conclus hard tell much test reaction honestli happen quit bit ow alreadi fp low ow mayb realli struggl frame look forward upcom game ow cyberpunk halo etc sell solid chunk cash get net loss realli smooth aaa game experi sound nice question nicer go hz game play keep mind get would go p play ow p render scale p much better game unless someon know way switch monitor center fli would go dual monitor rout buy cheaper p hz bottom line hz monitor even worth friend swear one describ ugli feel go happen similar fashion goe hard pictur spend get p setup properli switch main monitor easili could spend upgrad maxim cp game current monitor anyon gone pleas let know experi studi upgrad monitor

1. My  PC case (a prebuilt, Alienware X51 R2 with I7 4770) is too small for  any new GPU (even with half length cards, the problem is also with the  thickness and the height of the card.
2. The  PSU is external and ""laptop like"" (some kind of barrel plug, in the  back of the case, going to a breakout board inside), and I highly doubt  it would support a RTX 3000 card.

nvidia,"Hello all,

So I’ve been thinking of this Ampere release more than I should. Having spent £580 on a upper end 2070 super last month, I assume the price will plummet when Ampere releases. 

With many factors to consider the upgrade, I’d like to know what people’s general thoughts and experiences are with early adopted hardware especially regarding Ampere. 

Considering developmental production, and the updated variants like a SuperTi+ version entering the market at prices that essentially flips you off if you had already bought the original. Like, there’s no doubt whilst Ampere will be huge leap forward, NVIDIA will still do their market chicanery with fortune favouring the patient.

Don’t worry this is not another “shall I sell now or die worrying about it” thread, I just want to know NVIDIAs history regarding next gen launches. Do some of you guys just jump all in at launch? Or do some of you guys just bide your time and wait? And those who bide their time how well had their GPU hold in value and performance before they decided to buy in?

I think I already made my choice and keep my EVGA super until the 3080ti-3070ti is available OR a good sale is on maybe for Black Friday. But also, why not just sell now buy the early card then sell that and buy the updated variant when it comes out? Or maybe I’m just being an impatient little bish and either join at OnlyFans and cash out for that Ampere or shut up and wait and pay the difference when it comes time to upgrade. This really is my first time navigating a next gen launch with PC gaming so my experience is low and I’d appreciate some extra insight and not get sort of screwed like I did with my CPU being bought around launch time.",Early adoption and Ampere,hello think amper releas spent upper end super last month assum price plummet amper releas mani factor consid upgrad like know peopl gener thought experi earli adopt hardwar especi regard amper consid development product updat variant like superti version enter market price essenti flip alreadi bought origin like doubt whilst amper huge leap forward still market chicaneri fortun favour patient worri anoth shall sell die worri thread want know nvidia histori regard next gen launch guy jump launch guy bide time wait bide time well hold valu perform decid buy think alreadi made choic keep evga super ti ti avail good sale mayb black friday also sell buy earli card sell buy updat variant come mayb impati littl bish either join onlyfan cash amper shut wait pay differ come time upgrad realli first time navig next gen launch pc game experi low appreci extra insight get sort screw like bought around launch time earli adopt amper

One would think the FPS and Stability impact of any given graphic setting would be the same no matter the CPU and GPU setup. Yet Babeltech and Digital Foundry differ pretty significantly between each together.

-	Textures: Ultra

-	Anisotropic Filtering: Ultra
-	Shadows: High
-	Reflections: High

nvidia,"Hi,
For some reason my screen goes black everytime the graphics card is at load. I've done some extensive (and also amateur) troubleshooting and I've figured out that this only happens when the temperature hits 77C.

Does anyone know what the problem is and why this happens. And most importantly, if there's a way to fix it? This is really stressing me out and I don't I'll be able to sleep tonight.

It's a Palit Gaming Pro OC RTX 2080Ti.

The screen never goes black unless the temperature hits 77C or is above it. It can even handle short burst of overclock until the temperature very rapidly hits 77c?

I was thinking that it might be an issue with the thermal paste but I don't want to mess with it unless I'm sure.

I was hoping if someone who knows their stuff can take a look at this for me.

Update: Thank you all for your help. I wasn't expecting this much help and I really really REALLY appreciate it. Speaking to some of you really put a lot of the stress off my shoulders.

I've decided to give up and hopefully find a way to return this to the seller or simply open up a case with paypal/ebay as many of you have suggested.

I'm both physically and spiritually exhausted so I'm just going to fall asleep to a movie (maybe the matrix?) and see what needs to be done tomorrow.

nvidia,"In fullscreen exclusive, gsync is wonderful. It works.

In nvidia settings, I have it set to Fullscreen + Windowed.

&amp;#x200B;

In a borderless game, or a windowed game, or a fullscreen non-exclusive game, gsync KIND OF works, but not really.

After hours of testing - here's what I found...

&amp;#x200B;

When the frame rate is above 1/2 of the maximum refresh rate of the monitor in any of the above non fullscreen scenarios, the refresh rate will quickly and intermittently uncouple from the frame rate and go to maximum. Very fast. The game will feel like it's frame skipping and have a slight flicker/stutter to it. My monitor has a refresh rate overlay and I can see this happening.

&amp;#x200B;

If I cap the frame rate at 1/2 of the maximum refresh rate, minus 1 fps (i.e. 59FPS on 120hz, or 71FPS on 144hz) gsync works just as well as it did in fullscreen mode. If I cap the frame rate at exactly 1/2 or anything higher, the refresh rate stops smoothly tracking with the frame rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find a another person that has discovered this (possibly it's gone unnoticed or it's not a common issue)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So either no one realised, or it's a quirk with my particular monitor. (S2721DGF Nvidia Compatible Freesync Premium Pro 2)

Anyone notice this?

nvidia,"So I have 2 laptops,-

+An Asus with R5 3500u, 4GB ram, 500(?)gb ssd, and a GTX1050,

+An Acer predator with i5-9300h, 4GB ram, 1TB HDD, and a GTX1650

I play mainly valorant and when I do it with the Asus, It plays fine without any hiccups or stutters on low settings, and then I recently got the Acer which supposedly has a better cpu and gpu. 


The thing is, the Acer can run Valorant with high fps on high settings,, but it stutters a lot and stops the frame for a couple seconds before it comes back. Even if i put it on low settings, the fps count  remains stable but the game really hiccups and stutters. 


So I went to a group and asked about it and people kept telling me that the 4GB laptop ram was a bottleneck for my Acer's GTX1650. But I am unsure as to why that is so if the GTX1650 is just a little bit better than the GTX1050.


Another factor I could think of is that the disk usage on the Acer laptop's task manager goes up to 100% constantly as long as I run even just Valorant.



So my final questions are: (Focusing on what causes the stutters on the Asus laptop)

1) Is the 4gb laptop ram causing a bottleneck for the GTX1650 but not for the GTX1050(given that the latter has slightly lower specs)?

2) Or could the stutters be caused given that the Asus uses an SSD while the Acer uses an hdd?

3) Will adding an SSD and more ram completely remove the stutters on my Acer laptop? (or which of the 2, ssd or ram upgrade, is the primary shortcoming of the Acer laptop)

nvidia,"So, that leaked image this morning doesn't sit right with me. It is showing the bottom of the PCB but it's reversed. If this is the bottom of the card the PCI connector should be shown like this reversed. When you do that, then the leaked image, overlayed with the new cooler makes more sense.

The proc sits on the bottom side of the PCB with a fan above it sucking in cooler air from the bottom of the case. The other side of the PCB, which is conveniently blurred out sits with a heatsink on top.

I have a pretty great pc my cousin built me. It has the rtx2080ti and I love it. I don’t play many online games, but like assassins creed, rpgs, etc. graphics are more important than online response etc. 

I have about 2500 to spend (Canadian) and that puts me squarely in the market for a 75 inch Samsung QLED with 240motion rate which I hear is very important. 

For the same money I can get a 65 inch LG OLED. But, I don’t want a 65 inch. My current tv is 55 and it’s too small. I understand LG only makes 65 and 77 inch OLED and I’m confident 77 is WAY over my budget. Way over. 

So, my question is what would you guys do? I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to these things but I want a pretty tv. I don’t want to have regrets afterwards and get the 65 OLED, but I understand it’s the superior tv. 

I currently have a 240hz 55 inch 1080p tv that’s 8 years old and going into the bedroom. 

Is the QLED Samsung with 240 motion rate great? Will it blow my mind away regardless? This computer is so wonderful I really want it to shine without spending approximately 5k. I simply can’t without risking divorce. 

I’m hoping to be set up by assassins creed Valhalla being released so Black Friday options are on the table but I sincerely doubt 77 will come down into my range. If only there was a 70 inch oled.

nvidia,"This is an advice post seeing as I struggled with this issue for the longest time and believe I may have stumbled upon a solution recently. So for the longest time I have been trying to find a way to get my stream to be smooth. Now, when I say smooth, I mean during stream playback.

Settings for context:

\- New Nvenc encoder

\- CBR, 6000 bitrate, Keyframe Interval: 2, Profile: High, Look-ahead: disabled, Psycho VT: Enabled, Max   
  B-frames: 2

\- Tested 720p60fps/1080p60fps streams

For the longest time I have been interested in streaming, but was always put off by how choppy my stream would appear at random times. Although my hardware and internet speed/bandwidth have been more than enough for single PC streaming (RTX 2080ti/500 download 20 upload). The best way I can describe the ""choppiness"" is like if the stream goes down in frame rate (lets say from 60 to 30). At times it can even be more extreme and look like a slideshow for a brief period. I should also mention that OBS never reported any dropped frames during my streams and twitch inspector always showed ""Excellent"" status as well.

So, onto this ""solution."" Like many of you, I always had the Nvenc Encoder Preset set to ""Max Quality."" As I wanted to make sure my stream looked as good as it could since I lack a dual PC setup. Well, the other day I decided to lower that Preset to just ""Quality,"" one tier lower than the max. Upon my next stream I was amazed to actually watch the vod and not see any choppiness. I have been messing with streaming on Nvenc for so long and was convinced that it was just inferior and the choppiness was normal on it because I notice it on other streams as well. I even ask the other streamers if they are using Nvenc or have a dual setup and they usually say Nvenc nowadays.

Anyway, I am not certain that this preset change is what caused my stream to be smooth the whole time, but I don't see what else it could be. I have struggled with this for so long and for the first time EVER, my stream/VOD was smooth as butter and the Quality was  perfect! 1080p/60fps btw.

tl;dr: Have you ever seen your stream look like its not 60fps even though you show zero dropped frames and stream health is good? Lowering the Nvenc Preset from ""Max Quality"" to just ""Quality"" (or perhaps lower than that) might fix that issue!

nvidia,"So I'm looking at getting a new laptop, and while I don't want an actual ""gaming-specific"" laptop, I'm looking for something that can handle some gaming easily when I do want to play. I'm a fan of glossy displays, so I've really been thinking about the new HP Envy 15 OLED that comes with an RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU, i7-10750h, and 16GB RAM.

It's my understanding that the Max-Q GPUs are essentially slightly limited versions of their standard counterparts to help with efficiency in a laptop. But would a GPU like the 2060 Max-Q be a good choice for someone who isn't a competitive gamer or anything but still wants to game on high settings with ease, especially with OLEDs basically only being able to hit 60fps? And would this card be something that would hold up well over the next few years?

The current deal on the new Envy 15 is $1499 which seems hard to beat for that price and spec combination with the OLED/glossy screen which is why I'm considering it over the closest similar laptop that's around $2100 with the only difference being the regular RTX 2060 instead of the Max-Q. Would it be worth $600 to spring for the regular 2060?",Thoughts on 2060 Max-Q?,look get new laptop want actual game specif laptop look someth handl game easili want play fan glossi display realli think new hp envi ole come rtx max q h gb ram understand max q gpu essenti slightli limit version standard counterpart help effici laptop would like max q good choic someon competit gamer anyth still want game high set eas especi ole basic abl hit fp would card someth would hold well next year current deal new envi seem hard beat price spec combin ole glossi screen consid closest similar laptop around differ regular rtx instead max q would worth spring regular thought max q

I would like to have access to all of these features on my *primary* display while I am using my G-SYNC compatible monitor for gaming as my *secondary* display.

Need some advice/opinions please.

My current rig is an ageing 4th gen i7.

Spec:

Intel Core i7-4771  
32Gb RAM (4x8)  
512Gb Intel SSD boot drive (other drives are present but not relevant to this post!)  
nVidia GeForce GTX 960 4Gb

Monitors:

2x Dell U2412M 1920x1200 (DisplayPort, VGA, DVI-D)  
1x Dell U2415 1920x1200 (DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, 2x HDMI)  
1x Sharp 55"" 4k TV (HDMI)

I am not a pro gamer - my favourite games are the Unreal series, which up to the recent alpha, this card plays with no problems at all. I also play Dead By Daylight. It's with the Unreal alpha and DbD that I have problems - the 960 just doesn't quite cut it.

I tend to hold on to my PCs for a very long time - my previous PC was an Athlon64 6400+ which was bought new and lasted right up until 4th gen was current!

Budget restrictions prohibit me from buying a new PC, so I need to get a bit more life out of this one. What graphics card would you recommend for this PC? I feel like a 1660 or 2060 might be ok, but anything more powerful might be bottlenecked by the CPU?

Edited to note that I do not game on the 4k TV in 4k - I use one of the U2412Ms and occasionally mirror the output to the TV if someone's watching.

Appreciate your input!

nvidia,"Hello. At this point I am having really bad anxiety attacks because of the hell I've gone through with NVIDIA. Around June 22nd 2020 I requested an RMA because my RTX 2080 FE had a malfunction. The RMA was approved and I shipped my card with the FedEx prepaid label I was provided. When the graphics card was delivered to the warehouse I waited 5 days and I didn't get any response, so I had to contact NVIDIA. The representative told me everything was well and I needed to wait 48 hrs for the warehouse to process my replacement. I did not only wait 48 hrs, but 96 hrs and still nothing. I then contacted them back again and they told me that my graphics card was missing and that there was going to be a FedEx investigation. How do they tell me my replacement is being processed and then they tell me my return is missing? To not make this too long, there was a FedEx investigation and with they advised me to file a claim. The thing is that  to file the claim, NVIDIA needs to do the paperwork  because they paid for the shipping label. Now, they are telling me that they cannot help me because they did not receive anything and it is my fault. Can you believe it? Please advice me I am very mortified! Do you guys know if anyone here can help me from NVIDIA? (By the way worst RMA experience in my life)

Currently have a 7 year old Clevo laptop (3rd Gen i7 and GTX 670m) and 10 year old home built desktop (1st Gen i7 and ATI 5770) so realise whatever I buy is going to be a massive leap up in performance and ability.

My laptop is struggling and starting to fail so am seriously tempted to buy a laptop I have had my eye on with an AMD Ryzen 4800H with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 - 6.0GB GDDR6 built by PC Specialist using a Tongfang chassis.  My desktop I can leave for a while i.e. until Christmas time or maybe a bit longer where as my laptop is a more pressing update.

Graphics usage wise is Photoshop / Lightroom with the games I play / am interested in the highest graphics needed is a GTX 1050 Ti which would guess the 2060 will more than cover.  It is just everything I have read seems to imply the 3000 series will blow away the 2000 series but I could be interpreting it wrong.

Now from what I have read NVidia is due to release the 3000 series soon and having never really followed releases and such before so am I correct in thinking that the desktop versions will be out long before the laptop versions and for the later I should not be looking at seeing them in laptops until well into next year?

[Image Link - GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080 Founders Edition Power and Case Requiremen](https://preview.redd.it/zaz57oacflk51.jpg?width=2525&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c93d7a7a7eb33889d897e0776a1f7c369eaa19)

**Do the new RTX 30 Series require PCIE Gen 4? Do they support PCIE Gen 3? Will there be major performance impact for gaming?**

RTX 30 Series support PCIE Gen 4 and backwards compatible with PCIE Gen 3. System performance is impacted by many factors and the impact varies between applications. The impact is typically less than a few percent going from a x16 PCIE 4.0 to x16 PCIE 3.0. CPU selection often has a larger impact on performance.

**Does the RTX 30 Series support SLI?**

Only RTX 3090 support SLI configuration

**Will I need PCIE Gen 4 for RTX IO?**

Per Tony Tamasi from NVIDIA:

*There is no SSD speed requirement for RTX IO, but obviously, faster SSD’s such as the latest generation of Gen4 NVMe SSD’s will produce better results, meaning faster load times, and the ability for games to stream more data into the world dynamically. Some games may have minimum requirements for SSD performance in the future, but those would be determined by the game developers. RTX IO will accelerate SSD performance regardless of how fast it is, by reducing the CPU load required for I/O, and by enabling GPU-based decompression, allowing game assets to be stored in a compressed format and offloading potentially dozens of CPU cores from doing that work. Compression ratios are typically 2:1, so that would effectively amplify the read performance of any SSD by 2x.*

**Will I get a bottleneck from xxx CPU?**

If you have any modern multi-core CPU from the last several years, chances are you won't be bottlenecked but it depends on the game and resolution. The higher resolution you play, the less bottleneck you'll experience.

**Compatibility - NVIDIA Reflex, RTX IO, NVIDIA Broadcast**

*NVIDIA Reflex* \- GeForce GTX 900 Series and higher are supported

*RTX IO* \- Turing and Ampere GPUs

*NVIDIA Broadcast* \- Turing (20-Series) and Ampere GPUs

**Will there be 3090 Ti/Super, 3080 Ti/Super, 3070 Ti/Super**

Literally nobody knows.

# Q&amp;A Answers

With the announcement of the RTX 30-Series we knew that you had questions.

The community hosted a Q&amp;A on r/NVIDIA and invited eight of our top NVIDIA subject matter experts to answer questions from the community. While we could not answer all questions, we found the most common ones and our experts responded. Find the questions and answers below.

Be on the lookout for more community Q&amp;As soon as we deep dive on our latest technologies and help to address your common questions.

# RTX 30-Series

**Why only 10 GB of memory for RTX 3080? How was that determined to be a sufficient number, when it is stagnant from the previous generation?**

&gt;***\[Justin Walker\]*** *We’re constantly analyzing memory requirements of the latest games and regularly review with game developers to understand their memory needs for current and upcoming games. The goal of 3080 is to give you great performance at up to 4k resolution with all the settings maxed out at the best possible price.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In order to do this, you need a very powerful GPU with high speed memory and enough memory to meet the needs of the games. A few examples - if you look at Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Metro Exodus, Wolfenstein Youngblood, Gears of War 5, Borderlands 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 running on a 3080 at 4k with Max settings (including any applicable high res texture packs) and RTX On, when the game supports it, you get in the range of 60-100fps and use anywhere from 4GB to 6GB of memory.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Extra memory is always nice to have but it would increase the price of the graphics card, so we need to find the right balance.*

**When the slide says RTX 3070 is equal or faster than 2080 Ti, are we talking about traditional rasterization or DLSS/RT workloads? Very important if you could clear it up, since no traditional rasterization benchmarks were shown, only RT/DLSS supporting games.**

&gt;***\[Justin Walker\]*** *We are talking about both. Games that only support traditional rasterization and games that support RTX (RT+DLSS).*

**Does Ampere support HDMI 2.1 with the full 48Gbps bandwidth?**

&gt;***\[Qi Lin\]*** *Yes. The NVIDIA Ampere Architecture supports the highest HDMI 2.1 link rate of 12Gbs/lane across all 4 lanes, and supports Display Stream Compression (DSC) to be able to power up to 8K, 60Hz in HDR.*

**Could you elaborate a little on this doubling of CUDA cores? How does it affect the general architectures of the GPCs? How much of a challenge is it to keep all those FP32 units fed? What was done to ensure high occupancy?**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *One of the key design goals for the Ampere 30-series SM was to achieve twice the throughput for FP32 operations compared to the Turing SM. To accomplish this goal, the Ampere SM includes new datapath designs for FP32 and INT32 operations. One datapath in each partition consists of 16 FP32 CUDA Cores capable of executing 16 FP32 operations per clock. Another datapath consists of both 16 FP32 CUDA Cores and 16 INT32 Cores. As a result of this new design, each Ampere SM partition is capable of executing either 32 FP32 operations per clock, or 16 FP32 and 16 INT32 operations per clock. All four SM partitions combined can execute 128 FP32 operations per clock, which is double the FP32 rate of the Turing SM, or 64 FP32 and 64 INT32 operations per clock.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Doubling the processing speed for FP32 improves performance for a number of common graphics and compute operations and algorithms. Modern shader workloads typically have a mixture of FP32 arithmetic instructions such as FFMA, floating point additions (FADD), or floating point multiplications (FMUL), combined with simpler instructions such as integer adds for addressing and fetching data, floating point compare, or min/max for processing results, etc. Performance gains will vary at the shader and application level depending on the mix of instructions. Ray tracing denoising shaders are good examples that might benefit greatly from doubling FP32 throughput.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Doubling math throughput required doubling the data paths supporting it, which is why the Ampere SM also doubled the shared memory and L1 cache performance for the SM. (128 bytes/clock per Ampere SM versus 64 bytes/clock in Turing). Total L1 bandwidth for GeForce RTX 3080 is 219 GB/sec versus 116 GB/sec for GeForce RTX 2080 Super.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Like prior NVIDIA GPUs, Ampere is composed of Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs), Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), Raster Operators (ROPS), and memory controllers.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The GPC is the dominant high-level hardware block with all of the key graphics processing units residing inside the GPC. Each GPC includes a dedicated Raster Engine, and now also includes two ROP partitions (each partition containing eight ROP units), which is a new feature for NVIDIA Ampere Architecture GA10x GPUs. More details on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture can be found in NVIDIA’s Ampere Architecture White Paper, which will be published in the coming days.*

**Any idea if the dual airflow design is going to be messed up for inverted cases? More than previous designs? Seems like it would blow it down on the cpu. But the CPU cooler would still blow it out the case. Maybe it’s not so bad.**

**Second question. 10x quieter than the Titan for the 3090 is more or less quieter than a 2080 Super (Evga ultra fx for example)?**

&gt;***\[Qi Lin\]*** *The new flow through cooling design will work great as long as chassis fans are configured to bring fresh air to the GPU, and then move the air that flows through the GPU out of the chassis. It does not matter if the chassis is inverted.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Founders Edition RTX 3090 is quieter than both the Titan RTX and the Founders Edition RTX 2080 Super. We haven’t tested it against specific partner designs, but I think you’ll be impressed with what you hear… or rather, don’t hear. :-)*

**Will the 30 series cards be supporting 10bit 444 120fps ? Traditionally Nvidia consumer cards have only supported 8bit or 12bit output, and don’t do 10bit. The vast majority of hdr monitors/TVs on the market are 10bit.**

&gt;***\[Qi Lin\]*** *The 30 series supports 10bit HDR. In fact, HDMI 2.1 can support up to 8K@60Hz with 12bit HDR, and that covers 10bit HDR displays.*

**What breakthrough in tech let you guys massively jump to the 3xxx line from the 2xxx line? I knew it would be scary, but it's insane to think about how much more efficient and powerful these cards are. Can these cards handle 4k 144hz?**

&gt;***\[Justin Walker\]*** *There were major breakthroughs in GPU architecture, process technology and memory technology to name just a few. An RTX 3080 is powerful enough to run certain games maxed out at 4k 144fps - Doom Eternal, Forza 4, Wolfenstein Youngblood to name a few. But others - Red Dead Redemption 2, Control, Borderlands 3 for example are closer to 4k 60fps with maxed out settings.*

**What kind of advancements can we expect from DLSS? Most people were expecting a DLSS 3.0, or, at the very least, something like DLSS 2.1. Are you going to keep improving DLSS and offer support for more games while maintaining the same version?**

&gt;*DLSS SDK 2.1 is out and it includes three updates:*  
&gt;  
&gt;\- *New ultra performance mode for 8K gaming. Delivers 8K gaming on GeForce RTX 3090 with a new 9x scaling option.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\- *VR support. DLSS is now supported for VR titles.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*- Dynamic resolution support. The input buffer can change dimensions from frame to frame while the output size remains fixed. If the rendering engine supports dynamic resolution, DLSS can be used to perform the required upscale to the display resolution.*

**How bad would it be to run the 3080 off of a split connector instead of two separate cable. would it be potentially dangerous to the system if I’m not overclocking?**

&gt;*The recommendation is to run two individual cables. There’s a diagram here.* [*https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080/?nvmid=systemcomp*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080/?nvmid=systemcomp)

# RTX IO

**Could we see RTX IO coming to machine learning libraries such as Pytorch? This would be great for performance in real-time applications**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *NVIDIA delivered high-speed I/O solutions for a variety of data analytics platforms roughly a year ago with NVIDIA GPU DirectStorage. It provides for high-speed I/O between the GPU and storage, specifically for AI and HPC type applications and workloads. For more information please check out:* [*https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpudirect-storage/*](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpudirect-storage/)

**Does RTX IO allow use of SSD space as VRAM? Or am I completely misunderstanding?**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *RTX IO allows reading data from SSD’s at much higher speed than traditional methods, and allows the data to be stored and read in a compressed format by the GPU, for decompression and use by the GPU. It does not allow the SSD to replace frame buffer memory, but  it allows the data from the SSD to get to the GPU, and GPU memory much faster, with much less CPU overhead.*

**Will there be a certain ssd speed requirement for RTX I/O?**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *There is no SSD speed requirement for RTX IO, but obviously, faster SSD’s such as the latest generation of Gen4 NVMe SSD’s will produce better results, meaning faster load times, and the ability for games to stream more data into the world dynamically. Some games may have minimum requirements for SSD performance in the future, but those would be determined by the game developers. RTX IO will accelerate SSD performance regardless of how fast it is, by reducing the CPU load required for I/O, and by enabling GPU-based decompression, allowing game assets to be stored in a compressed format and offloading potentially dozens of CPU cores from doing that work. Compression ratios are typically 2:1, so that would effectively amplify the read performance of any SSD by 2x.*

**Will the new GPUs and RTX IO work on Windows 7/8.1?**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *RTX 30-series GPUs are supported on Windows 7 and Windows 10, RTX IO is supported on Windows 10.*

**I am excited for the RTX I/O feature but I partially don't get how exactly it works? Let's say I have a NVMe SSD, a 3070 and the latest Nvidia drivers, do I just now have to wait for the windows update with the DirectStorage API to drop at some point next year and then I am done or is there more?**

&gt;***\[Tony Tamasi\]*** *RTX IO and DirectStorage will require applications to support those features by incorporating the new API’s. Microsoft is targeting a developer preview of DirectStorage for Windows for game developers next year, and NVIDIA RTX gamers will be able to take advantage of RTX IO enhanced games as soon as they become available.*

# RTX Broadcast App

**What is the scope of the ""Nvidia Broadcast"" program? Is it intended to replace current GFE/Shadowplay for local recordings too?**

&gt;***\[Gerardo Delgado\]*** *NVIDIA Broadcast is a universal plugin app that enhances your microphone, speakers and camera with AI features such as noise reduction, virtual background, and auto frame. You basically select your devices as input, decide what AI effect to apply to them, and then NVIDIA Broadcast exposes virtual devices in your system that you can use with popular livestream, video chat, or video conference apps.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*NVIDIA Broadcast does not record or stream video and is not a replacement for GFE/Shadowplay*

**Will there be any improvements to the RTX encoder in the Ampere series cards, similar to what we saw for the Turing Release? I did see info on the Broadcast software, but I'm thinking more along the lines of improvements in overall image quality at same bitrate.**

&gt;***\[Jason Paul\]*** F*or RTX 30 Series, we decided to focus improvements on the video decode side of things and added* [*AV1 decode support*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-30-series-av1-decoding/)*. On the encode side, RTX 30 Series has the same great encoder as our RTX 20 Series GPU. We have also recently updated our NVIDIA Encoder SDK. In the coming months, livestream applications will be updating to this new version of the SDK, unlocking new performance options for streamers.*

**I would like to know more about the new NVENC -- were there any upgrades made to this technology in the 30 series? It seems to be the future of streaming, and for many it's the reason to buy nvidia card rather than any other.**

&gt;***\[Gerardo Delgado\]*** *The GeForce RTX 30 Series leverages the same great hardware encoder as the GeForce RTX 20 Series. We have also recently updated our Video Codec SDK to version 10.0. In the coming months, applications will be updating to this new version of the SDK, unlocking new performance options.*

**Regarding AV1 decode, is that supported on 3xxx series cards other than the 3090? In fact can this question and dylan522p question on support level be merged into: What are the encode/decode features of Ampere and do these change based on which 3000 series card is bought?**

&gt;***\[Gerardo Delgado\]*** *All of the GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs that we announced today have the same encoding and decoding capabilities:*  
&gt;  
&gt;\- *They all feature the 7th Gen NVIDIA Encoder (the one that we released with the RTX 20 Series), which will use our newly released Video Codec SDK 10.0. This new SDK will be  integrated in the coming months by the live streaming apps, unlocking new presets with more performance options.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*- They all have the new 5th Gen NVIDIA Decoder, which enables AV1 hardware accelerated decode on GPU. AV1 consumes 50% less bandwidth and unlocks up to 8K HDR video playback without a big performance hit on your CPU.*

# NVIDIA Omniverse Machinima

**How active is the developer support for Machinima? As it's cloud based, I'm assuming that the developers/publishers have to be involved for it to really take off (at least indirectly through modding community support or directly with asset access). Alongside this, what is the benefit of having it cloud based, short of purely desktop?**

&gt;***\[Richard Kerris\]*** *We are actively working with game developers on support for Omniverse Machinima and will have more details to share along with public beta in October.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Omniverse Machinima can be run locally on a GeForce RTX desktop PC or in the cloud. The benefit of running Omniverse from the cloud is easier real-time collaboration across users.*

# NVIDIA Studio

**Content creator here. Will these cards be compatible with GPU renderers like Octane/Arnold/Redshift/etc from launch? I know with previous generations, a new CUDA version coincided with the launch and made the cards inert for rendering until the 3rd-party software patched it in, but I'm wondering if I will be able to use these on launch day using existing CUDA software.**

&gt;***\[Stanley Tack\]*** *A CUDA update will be needed for some renderers. We have been working closely with the major creative apps on these updates and expect the majority (hopefully all!) to be ready on the day these cards hit the shelves.*

# NVIDIA Reflex

**Will Nvidia Reflex be a piece of hardware in new monitors or will it be a software that other nvidia gpus can use?**

&gt;***\[Seth Schneider\]*** *NVIDIA Reflex is both. The NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer is a revolutionary new addition to the G-SYNC Processor that enables end to end system latency measurement. Additionally, NVIDIA Reflex SDK is integrated into games and enables a Low Latency mode that can be used by* ***GeForce GTX 900 GPUs and up*** *to reduce system latency. Each of these features can be used independently.*

 **Is NVIDIA Reflex just a rebranding of NVIDIA’s Ultra Low Latency mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel?**

&gt;No, NVIDIA Reflex is different. Ultra Low Latency mode is a control panel option, whereas NVIDIA Reflex gets integrated by a game developer directly into the game.  Through native game integration and enhanced algorithms, NVIDIA Reflex is much more effective in optimizing a game’s rendering pipeline for lowest latency.  
&gt;  
&gt; See our Reflex article here to learn more: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform/) 

**The Ultra Low Latency mode supported CS:GO and Rainbow Six:Siege, why doesn’t NVIDIA Reflex?** 

&gt;Unlike the NVIDIA Ultra Low Latency mode, NVIDIA Reflex provides an SDK that the developers must integrate. Having our technology directly in the game engine allows us to align game simulation and render work in a way that streamlines latency.  We’ve currently announced support coming for top games including Fortnite, Valorant, Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Destiny 2.  We look forward to adding as many titles as possible to our supported title list. 

**Does NVIDIA Reflex lower FPS performance to reduce latency?**

&gt;The industry has long optimized for FPS, so much so that there have been massive latency trade-offs made to squeeze out every last 0.5% FPS improvement. NVIDIA Reflex takes a new look at optimizing the rendering pipeline for end to end system latency.  While our research shows that latency is the key metric for aim precision and reaction speed, we understand FPS is still an important metric; so NVIDIA Reflex aims to reduce latency while maintaining  FPS. In the majority of cases, Reflex can achieve latency reduction without any FPS impact.  In a few cases, gamers may see small 0-2% FPS impacts alongside larger latency gains -- a good tradeoff for competitive games.  Of course, Reflex is a setting in-game, so gamers can choose for themselves.  Based on our testing though, we believe you’ll find little reason to ever play with it off. 

# PCIE Gen4

**Will customers find a performance degradation on PCIE 3.0?**

&gt;*System performance is impacted by many factors and the impact varies between applications. The impact is typically less than a few percent going from a x16 PCIE 4.0 to x16 PCIE 3.0. CPU selection often has a larger impact on performance.We look forward to new platforms that can fully take advantage of Gen4 capabilities for potential performance increases.*",NVIDIA RTX 30-Series – You Asked.

nvidia,"I think its safe to say a lot of people will be upgrading to the 30 series in the next few months. Some people will wait for reviews and benchmarks, but if you have a 20 series card like me, you want to buy into the 30 series at launch to be able to sell your old card before it completely loses value.

So in this panic of trying to organise getting a 30 series card at launch I fell down a wormhole of ""FE vs Third party"", 12pin vs dual 8pin"", ""good customer service vs bad customer service"" etc. Some of these things are important to know and others will keep you up at night wondering if you picked the right card. I wanted to highlight a couple of points I came across while asking around about the new cards.

&amp;#x200B;

* Founders Edition cards are not reference cards this time around
* FE cards will likely be some of the cheaper cards, but nvidia sub-contract their customer service and if you have any issues or reasons for RMA their customer service is traditionally very poor
* Third party cards will launch same day and time as FE cards **- Not ALL third party cards but a lot seem to be. Will include a link to provide solid evidence if found. - They will release at 2pm BST, 6am PT on Sept 17th.**
* Third party cards usually have preferred cooling solutions, but the FE have a unique cooling set up this time around so maybe a smaller difference here, time will tell
* The FE cards have a 12pin input. There will be a dual 8pin to 12pin cable provided in the box for your PSU
* The Asus ROG Strix requires three 8pin PCIE inputs, make sure you have this on your PSU **- Third 8pin may be found to be optional, waiting for reviews to confirm**
* EVGA apparently have extremely good track record with build quality, longevity and customer service **- This has been highlighted 10 fold in the comments.**
* There are lots of card manufacturers you may not have heard of before if you're new to this. Zotac, PNY, Colorful iGame, Palit etc. Does anyone have more specific experiences with these brands as I haven't dealt with them before. **- Most third parties are manufactured in Taiwan, except Colorful it seems. Taiwan manufactured cards seem to be more reliable.**
* **Best Buy seem to have the FE listed in the US, it may be smart to buy the card here and dealing with their returns policy over directly communicating with Nvidia's poor customer service. Depends on Best Buy returns policy which you should confirm yourself.**
* **650W should be fine for most people. Use** [**https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator**](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) **to confirm your PC's power usage.**
* **3070 only uses one 8pin connector**

These are just some points I've come across. I'd love for people to add more points in the comments, mostly revolving around all the different variations of the 30 series cards. What I means by that is Asus having Dual vs Tuf Gaming vs ROG Strix, what are the main differences? If they are all a 3080 card say will there really be much difference between the cards, besides cooling and overclocking say? Are there major differences between the different third party manufacturers?

Any other experiences, tips, highlights I think will help people a lot.

**Edit: changed some of my initial points to highlight new info in the comments**

nvidia,"So take this information with a huge grain of salt. Just because the response was “I don’t know” means they’re probably being truthful, but also might mean they aren’t authorized to know anything. I hope this helps!

I emailed Zotac, Asus, Gigabyte, and EVGA about when their RTX 3090’s (didn’t ask about the 3080 or 3070) might be available in the USA. I went to the contact pages of the sites and tried looking for sales contacts. Sometimes those links sent me to general customer service. I didn’t ask about publishing their responses, so to be safe, I redacted names. Here’s what I received:

nvidia,"Curious to see if those who built systems a few years ago plan to upgrade. 

I built my system when the 1000 series launched. I got a 1070 and upgraded to the 1080Ti as I was able to get close to retail when I sold my card. 

My card is still solid and my rug runs everything I throw at it from Red Dead to Star Citizen to the latest Total War games.

I would like to play Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest settings but the cost would be more than the card as my Z170 board would need to be upgraded, as well as my i7-6700k. So figure another 500 on top of cost of card, I'll likely put it off unless something bad happens. If I wasn't saving for a car, I might consider it

nvidia,"On the one hand, this is a very powerful 2080 Ti level graphics card. On the other hand, only 8 GB of video memory. I'm afraid that I simply won't be able to set the maximum settings in 4k games, because I will always get stutters and FPS drops due to the out of VRAM. If so, what is the point of such power? Is it worth it then to take 3080, of which 10 GB already look more or less comfortable, although there are games that can use more than 10 GB of memory. Or is it better to wait for the 3070 TI / Super release, but will there be any and if so, when. It literally torments me. Why can't I just go buy a graphics card and enjoy it with nvidia deciding to drastically cut the VRAM of 3070-3080 graphics cards. Do they really think that 8 GB is enough for video cards of this capacity? Apex Legends consumes 8+ GB, WarZone - 10+ GB. Many singles games can easily exceed 8+ GB in 4k as well.

My personal goal is to get the maximum settings in 4k, albeit with 40-50 frames, the main thing is without statters and FPS drops, so I would prefer 3070 TI / Super 16 GB for a more moderate price.

What is the best way to avoid getting a card that will become useless in a couple of years due to a lack of VRAM?

nvidia,"Hi, I know a LOT of people are now discussing FE vs AIB and im kinda in the same boat - I'm really interested in buying FE 3080. My problem is, I have no experience with buying directly from Nvidia and I dont really know what i can expect. My questions are:
1) Is the packaging and delivery reliable, secure? Should i worry about getting my new GPU in broken package in 3 pieces? Is there a possibility they lose my package?
2) How complicated is the RMA process? Im from the Czech Republic and i guess I'll have to fill out some forms, then mail it somewhere, wait a lot of time... is it really worth the risk?

I would really like to buy FE, but considering i can just pick up any AIB the next day in my nearest vendor and in case RMA it equally fast... I really dont know. Im still waiting on the AIB prices but something tells me they will be significantly more expensive than FE, in which case i would like to buy FE just simply because its cheaper.

nvidia,"The ASUS Strix is specifically described as having ""up to 400W of total board power to play with."" [https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-graphics-cards/introducing-geforce-rtx-3070-rtx-3080-rtx-3090-rog-asus/]
It achieves this by using 3x8-pins, and intentionally bypassing the 75w power available via the PCI slot itself. Technically 3x8pin alone could provide 450w (150w each), but Asus appears to have chosen to limit that to 400w, probably via their vBIOS.

Do we have any similar info for other AIBs? Should we assume that other AIBs that have stated using 3x8pins will use those 3 PLUS the PCI slot power delivery? For a potential max of 525w? 

In previous gens, cards with 2x8-pin used the theoretical max of 375w (example FTW3 Ultra where the vBIOS allowed power limit to go to 373w). I don't exactly understand ASUS's reasoning behind bypassing the PCI slot, and I'd wonder if others will follow suit or gain an inherit advantage by maximizing their power delivery.

By the way, I'm a guy who always plays 1080p or lower resolutions in all low settings and I'm not interested in RTX or anything like that so the game looks better to me, I'm just aiming for FPS.

nvidia,"So guys,

i was just thinking about the used market for gpus. Saw a lot of posts of 2080 ti below 500$ on ebay. But how about the other cards. Well i wrote down the price of the FE of all the 20xx card the day before the presentation as reported on the nvidia website as you can see from the picture.

Also i put a column with the % of price of each card with the 2080 Ti. Next step is try to understand the value of an used 2080Ti. Let's assume that the speed is the same of the 3070 but there are less features so people will not pay the same money but a little bit less. Also let's keep in mind the card is 2 years old so in average it should be 1 year plus old (i think the amount of people buying the 2080 Ti from june 2020 was much less than any other month before as the 30xx was in the air). So i assumed 400 dollars should be a fair assumption. If you use the same proportion on the prices compared with the new cards you will see in the third column the calculated values for the other 3 cards. Next thing to consider is that the 2080 Ti was overpriced probably. So i assumed that am used 2080 super fair price today would be not 273$ but 100$ less than an used 2080 Ti. And then i calculated the other 2 values using the price of the 2080 Super as base.

I think these are fair assumptions at least until the 3060 and the equivalent of the 1660 super are presented.

However that seems to not be the case for the 3090? It seems to have lower base clock AND lower boost clock than 3080, and even lower clock than the ""budget"" 3070. So it seems like 3090 for gaming will be WORSE than other cards?

nvidia,"#Purpose

Since the unveiling of Ampere I've seen a lot of contradictory and incorrect statements regarding the generation-over-generation performance changes. The key statement I'm seeing is a variation of ""Turing's performance gain was smaller than normal, and Ampere is a return to normal."" This actually hasn't been the case, and I want to highlight that with actual data.

So the purpose is to better educate users on the generation-over-generation performance gains from Nvidia's product stack.

#Methodology

There is no perfect way to do this. But I am going to try to do this as fairly as possible, and to go as far back as possible. Here are the key points to my methodology.

* Performance data will be used from [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/). Why? They've provided consistently good data for years, they compare numerous GPUs in each review, and they use geometric mean as their performance average, with that average taken from a buttload of games, not just the 3-5 in standard reviews.
* Because multiple resolutions are tested, I will use the data from the highest resolution tested as a means to reduce the impact of CPU bottlenecks on the data. **For those who saw my smaller charts as comments in the prior threads, I was previously using mid-resolutions, which were more subject to CPU bottlenecks. This is why the data looks slightly different.**
* Performance gains will be expressed over the prior marketed generation. IE, even though they are both Fermi, I will treat the 400 and 500 series as separate generations because that is how Nvidia marketed them.
* I will use the x60, x70, and x80 products, as they have been a mainstay since Fermi. I will not use Ti, Super, or Titan products as they have been inconsistently placed throughout Nvidia's history.
* If a product was offered in multiple memory configurations, I will try to use either the launch-day config (IE, GTX 1060 6GB), or the larger config if launched on the same day (IE, GTX 960 4GB).
* Reference results will be used (and that means FE results once those became Nvidia's ""reference,"" even though technically a few 20-series FEs were overclocked above official reference spec).

#Flaws in the Methodology

* One could argue that Fermi (400/500 series) and Kepler (600/700 series) should each be treated as one generation, IE, the 480 and 580 could be treated like the 2080 and 2080 Super. This is a valid viewpoint, but I felt that treating them as the separate generations that Nvidia marketed them as would be the most fair way to do it.
* By limiting myself to just Techpowerup, I am limiting myself to one source. And like any popular tech review source, it will have its fans and critics. There will be people who feel that my entire post is invalid for using them. All that I can say is that every tech reviewer has flaws, and TPU has been one of the most consistently good sources of this kind of data for a long time. Aggregating their data for this post made it easier and, actually, feasible.
* The numbers reflect the launch state of a GPU over the existing state of a prior GPU. So, the GTX 1080 over 980 numbers reflect a fresh GTX 1080 on launch drivers against a mature GTX 980 that is probably further ahead of the 780 than it was at its launch. Due to this, you should not be using these numbers to calculate cumulative gains from Fermi through Turing as you will be missing the driver-based gains between launches.

#Generational Gains - x60, x70, and x80

Note: The 400 series is reflecting performance gains over the 200 series. There was only a GTX 260 and 280, no GTX 270. (Yes, I'm aware of the 275/285 refreshes)

Series|x60|x70|x80
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
400-Series|+15.38%|N/A|+56.25%
500-Series|+19.05%|+25.00%|+16.28%
600-Series|+41.15%|+36.99%|+29.87%
700-Series|+25.00%|+13.64%|+26.58%
900-Series|+11.11%|+41.18%|+31.58%
10-Series|**+104.08%**|**+66.67%**|**+69.49%**
20-Series|+56.25%|+33.33%|+31.58%
AVERAGE|+38.86%|+36.14%|+37.38%

##Generational Gains - Anomalies in the above data.

* TPU's GTX 660 review did not include a GTX 560 for comparison. As such, I had to use two reviews to extrapolate the data.
* TPU only reviewed the 2GB variant of the GTX 960. However, especially at launch, there was no performance difference between the two cards based on most review sources.

##Generational Gains - Analysis


Looking at this reminds me of the targeted pay raises you'd see in milpay charts. It's clear that rather than going for a uniform generational increase, Nvidia had targeted increases for specific reasons. For example, the GTX 970 was insanely popular. Why? It was very close to 980 performance, but $220 cheaper. It was FAR ahead of the 960 in performance, but only $100 more expensive than the 4GB variant. The 970 was the most logical choice for prospective 900-series owners. Nvidia corrected this by narrowing the 1060/1070 performance gap (the 960 --&gt; 1060 upgrade path was a greatest generation-over-generation improvement I've seen since the Voodoo 2). The RTX 2060 saw further gains over its cohorts in the Turing-based 20-series.

The key takeaways should be:

* ~37.5% is the average generation-over-generation performance uplift.
* Turing's performance uplift was about average. Marginally below average for the x70 and x80, but way above average for the x60. Turing's problem wasn't the performance uplift, it was the huge price hike, which invalidated the performance uplift for many.
* Pascal (10-series) saw the greatest generation-over-generation performance uplift. Users saying that this was ""normal"" are beholden to recency bias.
* As expected, the 500-series and 700-series (Fermi ""2"" and Kepler ""2"") were the worst performance gains. As I stated earlier, you're not wrong if you feel that I should have treated these like the 20-Super series. But Nvidia marketed them as whole new products so they were treated as such.

#How it stacked up - x60

Here I'll examine how each x60 product stacked up against the prior generation lineup. I'll do the same for the x70 and x80 below. Why do this? Nvidia claimed that the 3070 has &gt; 2080 Ti performance. I want to see how often this happens. In each segment, I'll attempt to project the Ampere variant's real-world performance uplift. This is solely for fun and should not be taken as gospel. Because this is time-consuming, I'm not going back to Fermi. Instead, I'm going to start with Maxwell. This allows me to compare to prior x80 Ti products since the 780 Ti was the return of this suffix.

Also, math is funny. To be consistent, I wanted to use the card in the left column as the base. So while the GTX 960 is 29.08% slower than the GTX 780, using the 780 as the base, the 780 is 41% faster than the 960. If this is confusing, here's an easier to follow example. Let's say that the GTX A is half the speed of the GTX B. That means that GTX A is 50% slower, or, GTX B is 100% faster.

GPU|Prior x60|Prior x70|Prior x80
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
GTX 960|+11.11%|-10.71%|-29.08%
GTX 1060|+104.08%|+17.65%|+1.01%
GTX 2060|+56.25%|+17.65%|-2.00%

The GTX 960 was not a good card, as I mentioned earlier. It was telling that prior X60s were advertised as mainstream AAA gaming cards, but the GTX 960's marketing campaign revolved around esports titles. The GTX 960 was a marginal upgrade over the GTX 760. It really wasn't worth buying for an x60 owner unless you were still on Fermi.
 
But the GTX 1060 changed that, roughly doubling the 960's performance. It beat out the prior generation GTX 970, while roughly matching the GTX 980. We saw more of the same from the RTX 2060. It was a worthy upgrade for GTX 1060 owners, beat out the GTX 1070, and roughly matched the GTX 1080. With DLSS, it actually comes out ahead in some modern titles.

Where should the RTX 3060 line up? The optimistic side of me expects RTX 2080 performance out of it. But the pessimistic side of me thinks that Nidia might want to revert some of the massive gains the x60 has had in recent generations. I could see it roughly matching the RTX 2070, keeping the 6GB VRAM of prior cards, and being offered at $349. This would allow room for a Ti or Super to come in with 8GB of RAM and RTX 2080-like performance once AMD plays their hand, while still retaining a spot for the 3070. Like the 900-series, I suspect this is going to be a generation where Nvidia tries to coax traditional x60 buyers into an x70.


#How it stacked up - x70

GPU|Prior x70|Prior x80|Prior x80 Ti
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
GTX 970|+41.18%|+17.07|-4.95%
GTX 1070|+66.67%|+40.85%|+13.64%
GTX 2070|+33.33%|+12.36%|-6.54%

The GTX 970 was a great card and the 1070 was even better. As we can see here, the x70 trading blows with the prior x80 Ti has occurred every generation since the re-introduction of the x80 Ti. Therefore, we should not be shocked that Nvidia is claiming that the RTX 3070 is faster than the RTX 2080 Ti.

My projection isn't quite as rosy. From Nvidia's claims, it appears that their comparison includes a lot of RTX titles. Most games still don't support DLSS and/or ray-tracing. I think that the RTX improvements bring the average up, and rasterization brings it down. As such, I expect the 3070 to be slightly faster than the 2080 Ti in RTX-enabled titles, but slightly slower in non-RTX-enabled titles. Also, in that same chart Nvidia claimed that the 3080 was twice as fast as the 2080, but the preview that we saw from Digital Foundry showed more of a roughly ~80% improvement. So, be pessimistic until we get real reviews.

#How it stacked up - x80

GPU|Prior x80|Prior x80 Ti
:--|:-:|:-:
GTX 980|+31.58%|+7.53%
GTX 1080|+69.49%|+36.99%
GTX 2080|+31.58%|+8.70%

Seems a bit like a tick-tock cycle. Compared to the prior x80 Ti, we see slighter faster, much faster, slightly faster...so the next one would be ""much faster."" And that is what Nvidia has claimed, that the 3080 would be noticeably faster than the 2080 Ti, and double the performance of the 2080. As noted above, DF's preview showed the 3080 as being roughly 80% faster than the 2080 in games pre-selected by Nvidia. I think the worst case that we can expect is a card that improves over its predecessor much like the 1080 did. That's a pretty damn good worst case.

#Conclusion

This was a data-driven post so the conclusion depends on the questions that you had and the perspective you have coming into this. We can conclude that Turing was not a subpar performance uplift, just an ""average"" uplift paired with a price hike. Pascal was not a typical uplift, but instead, the best uplift Nvidia has had in at least a decade. And we can see that Ampere seeks to match or even beat that amazing uplift.

If you're an x80 buyer, the RTX 3080 looks to give the best generation-over-generation uplift we've seen in the segment, at least over the last decade. Worst case is that it ""only"" duplicates Pascal's uplift. This is going to be a great card.

If you're an x70 buyer, you should expect more of what you're used to - performance within spitting distance of last generation's x80 Ti. Best case is that it's a littler faster, and worst case is that it's a little slower. There is no bad news here, unless you recently bought a 2080 Ti.

But if you're an x60 buyer, there's some uncertainty. Nvidia has good reasons to release a 2080 competitor (if AMD has something competitive in the next few months), and good reasons to launch a cheaper dud with 6GB of VRAM (to leave plenty of space for a Ti/Super, and to encourage x60 owners to move to a 3070). There's a lot of latitude here and I'm curious to see which direction Nvidia ultimately goes with this card.

nvidia,"With the eminent release of Ampere, many people are selling their current cards. People are buying stuff like 5700XTs or 1080 Ti's for $350-400, 1080s for $300 while there are plenty of RTX cards being sold for 250-450. ""High end"" RTX 2070 and 2080 Supers go for about $400ish, and even the 2080 Ti is going for about $550-650. 

We love to push the narrative that Turing was a failure, Pascal is awesome, but don't drink the kool-aid and end up with outdated cards missing important features. If you have any interest in new games at all, you'll be paying just about the same price to play at either the same frame rate without raytracing (the new low setting), or at a much slower frame rate without DLSS. A 2070 is capable of getting RTX 1440p 60fps with DLSS. With consoles getting raytracing support, as performance heavy as it may be, the rate of  adoption will only increase. 

The alternative is you just bought a used $300+ graphics card to play at low settings or lower framerates.

   - i'm curious about what chip gets attached to the pcb under the top displayport connector. any ideas? maybe a converter for a dp alt mode?



------



the founders' rtx 3080, which has 10 chips on one side in a similar arrangement surrounding the gpu. i can't find pictures of the founders' rtx 3080fe, but we know it must be an inch shorter than in the picture of the rtx 3090fe pcb above. it is conceivable that the rtx 3080fe pcb is similar to the rtx 3090fe pcb, but smaller, without the empty space on top, and pads for only 10 gddr6x chips... and probably less pads for vrms.

- [from nvidia's rtx 3080fe product page](https://i.imgur.com/2FXTCRQ_d.jpg?maxwidth=2048&amp;fidelity=high)
   - notable features:
      - 12 gddr6x chips surrounding the gpu
         - right off the bat, this is showing 12gb, so it can't be an rtx 3080fe, but it does demonstrate that a pcie sig spec compliant 112mm (4.4-inch) pcb can fit the memory and vrms of the rtx 3090.
      - does not have nvlink edge card connector
      - shows new 12-pin power connector

from ek's rtx 3000 series waterblock announcement:

- [engineering sample reference  pcb, claimed to be rtx 3090](https://www.tweaktown.com/images/news/7/4/74958_79_nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-series-founders-not-reference-they-are-custom_full.png)
   - [source](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/74958/nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-series-founders-not-reference-they-are-custom/index.html)
   - notable features:
      - 12 gddr6x chips surrounding the gpu in the same configuration as the rtx 3090fe pcb
      - same vrm configuration as the rtx 3090fe pcb
         - some vrms are crooked and look hand soldered. this is indicative of an engineering sample, which is confirmed by the markings on the gpu.
      - nvlink edge card connector located top/front
      - no v cutout
      - pcie sig spec compliant ~112mm (~4.4-in) pcb height. i estimate this to be 10-10.5-in long
      - dual 8-pin pcie molex minifit-jr power connectors
      - 3 displayport and a funky hdmi outputs
         - is the bottom video output hdmi, and is the connector a stacked pair?
      - semicircular plated screw hole just above the top displayport pads
      - different port configuration and less length than an rtx 2080ti, as well as different ram chip layout.



------


from what limited information is available to be seen:

- the pcb for the rtx 3090fe appears to be gratuitously large and contain a lot of empty looking space.


- both nvidia's own rendering and ek's reference pcb showing off their waterblock show 12 gddr6x chips on the front side, the same number of vrms as the rtx 3090fe and a nvlink connector. although neither of these pcbs have pictures of their backsides, it is not inconceivable that it has an additional 12 gddr6x chips, and are therefore either rtx 3090 gpus with 24gb.


- a case could be made the later 2 pcbs are as-of-yet unspecified quadro gpus *without* ecc and missing *rear* facing pcie power connectors like every other quadro (and tesla) of the past handful of generations. i do not believe that this is what i spent a lot of time staring at.


as always, thank you for reading, and i would *love* additional information or plausible alternative explanations :)

nvidia,"I'm in my 30s so definitely not new to the computer game, but I have been pretty diehard Mac up until now so I'm very new to the individual parts aspect of computers. I think I have finally seen the light about the absurd markup for inferior hardware and with COVID, I no longer need to be mobile so the MacBook Pro's build quality means nothing to me now.

My current work from home setup is dual Dell 1440p monitor set up (side by side to create a sort of DIY ultrawide) hooked up to my MBP which I dock. My MBP is slowly dying and I really want to get back into PC gaming (flight sims) since I have a whole bunch of time on my hands, and I've decided on pretty much everything for my build and have been collecting parts in anticipation of building it and the new Nvidia releases.

I currently have an unopened EVGA 2070S that I bought at Best Buy. I wanted to get one before stock was lost and I had a coupon/eGC so figured it was best to get one and then hold it in the return window while the new cards were announced. Seeing those new cards, I definitely would like to jump up to a 3080 for that price and (supposed) gains, but I am concerned about availability. I can wait a few weeks, maybe even a month, but much longer than that I'm not sure I can justify it. My current computer is becoming unworkable and since I'm self-employed, I just cannot afford the down time.

In terms of gaming, the only things I want to play are flight sims. MSFS2020, DCS, etc. I don't care about shooters or competitive gaming, I never will, I just want to be able to fly flight sims and do work, edit photos, etc. I would, at some point, like to get into VR for the flight sims but that will be a bit I think. I don't necessarily need to run MSFS2020 on 1440p and Ultra, but I would like to at least be in the High area.

Taking that into account and recognizing that I don't need extreme FPS for flight sims, just how much real world gain will I see if I return the 2070S and go with a 3080 (assuming I can get one). I know these questions are getting tiring for most of you, but most of the recommendations and discussions I see about these GPUs revolve around games where you desperately need every last frame of high fps and that just isn't me. Recognizing that, is a 3080 or 3070 going to really do that much better? So much so that it is worth waiting for it if I can't get one at release?

For reference, the rest of the build that I've decided on is a Ryzen 3700X (I know there aren't many gains to be had over the 3600 in gaming, but this will be a work computer also), and probably a B450 Tomahawk Max motherboard unless I can find a MSI X570 somewhere in stock soon. I already have a 750W PSU ready to go, so I think I can power any of these new cards just fine. The only other thing I am waiting for is a case, since I wasn't sure just how big these new cards would be if I went that rate.

If you've successfully gotten to the end of this lengthy post, I sincerely thank you. This entire thing is just melting my brain to the point where I almost want to shove the 2070S in there and delete reddit so I stop thinking about it, even though I know the 3080 will probably be way better.

The RTX 3090 FE is 12.3"" x 5.4"" x 3-Slo - which means I need an extra ~0.2” in length and ~1” in height to fit in addition to my current card, correct?

nvidia,"Because of the recent talk about DX12-Ultimate, DLSS 2.1 and coming to VR, and the Ampere Q&amp;A, I thought I should post about this thought I've had.

I don't know if it's appropriate to tag NV_Tim (I haven't, in case it isn't, haha), as he's the one the Q&amp;A information came from. Or someone else?

Onto the point:

As Variable Rate Shading is one of the important DX12-Ultimate features, and should be coming to most games in the near-future, could DLSS synergise with it to ""have your cake and eat it too""?

I don't mean just being able to turn both on at the same time, I mean effectively having multiple of the DLSS presets running at the same time, on different parts of the image.

[See example mockup](https://i.imgur.com/EDIuGqp.jpg)

Since VRS allows for different portions of the screen to be rendered at different resolutions, it seems reasonable in principle this could be extended to allow DLSS to run at different render resolutions for different parts of the screen.

This could be called VRDLSS (Variable Rate DLSS), or similar.

If doable, could this allow for the image quality delivered by ""quality"" preset while getting the performance of ""balanced"", or better?

And as a little incentive/marketing, it could be implemented within the VRS setting in games. e.g. the VRS setting could be a dropdown box with ""On"" or ""VRDLSS (Nvidia only)"", or similar.

-------
-------

#For VR:

If the above is viable, now DLSS is coming to VR could this also be extended to VR?

Because of how the eye works, and the relationship between FOV and visual quality, could the render resolution be reduced as the FOV increases?

Basically the same principle of Foveated rendering.

[See example mockup](https://i.imgur.com/HRNRaXZ.jpg)

The ""peripheral"" preset could be much lower, such as the new 1/9th resolution from the 8K DLSS mode, because this is far outside our quality visual field. And also, for now anyway, well outside of the sweet-spot for lenses.

Until lens technology dramatically improves, the outer parts of the screen can be relatively garbage quality and it doesn't make a difference. Apart from things like being temporally stable and not overly aliased, the same as research into Foveated rendering has suggested.

This should allow for very dramatic performance improvements even without full Foveated rendering. And could also work alongside Foveated rendering once it's ready.

nvidia,"This has probably been addressed before however i have a few questions and a major lack of understanding.

Looking to upgrade towards the end of this year, though my intent isn't to upgrade for higher resolutions, its to upgrade so i can achieve higher FPS rates for higher refresh rates while being able to visually enjoy the game (as opposed to downgrading graphics to achieve higher refresh rates consistently). 

I've been overwhelmingly told that both the 3080 and 3090 would be overkill for 1080p gaming. I still haven't really had the ""why"" explained. 

My main confusions can be summed up in a few questions;

1. Lets make a hypothetical situation, if i was playing CoD Warzone and i wanted to run the game at nuts graphics, everything at absolutely maximum but also aim for 144Hz / 240Hz on my current rig i'd suffer, i typically have to downgrade graphics somewhat to achieve 120-ish on my 1080ti. I notice more than marginal difference on graphics settings in said game and rendering. If i were to hypothetically upgrade from say a 1080ti to a 3080 / 3090, where the difference in base statistics is almost double, on the maximum possible graphics in a game like Warzone, would i see higher FPS than on my 1080ti on medium settings? 
2. Why would say a 3080 or 3090 be overkill for achieving maximum possible frames in a modern title while also running on high graphical settings?

After seeing the earlier post showing that EKWB's water block isn't actually compatible with the Founder's Edition cards, I set to find out which cards from the AIB partners are actually reference designs. I got in touch with someone at EVGA via their chat and learned some concerning information.

According to EVGA, Nvidia has not supplied a reference design for the 3000 series cards. All AIB partners are creating their own PCB designs, meaning that water blocks will likely need to be custom made for each card manufacturer unless the block designer can make one that fits multiple PCB layouts.

As a follow-up I asked about the availability of the hydro copper series and EVGA suggested that their water cooled cards will come out at a later date.

So for all of us looking to water cool our new 3000 cards out of the gate, this might be more challenging than in the past. I now have no idea which card to buy.

nvidia,"I have an MSI Trident X plus with i9 9900k / 32GB Ram and 2080Ti  
Am i able to upgrade to a 3090 when it comes out? Asking because of size and because my rig is intel based and I heard something about the pcie being 4.0 and that AMD can take advantage of the new cards more or something? I dont know. I know id have to upgrade my 650 PSU but would just like to know if I should save up for the card.  
Id be looking to play with a 1440p superwide display not 4K if this helps.   
Thanks in advance

Given the upcoming decrease in prices for the 2080 series, I figured it might be time to buy a second card (rather than updating to a 3080, which would only have 10 gigs).

Reading online though, ive come across some conflicting information on what is compatible.   I know I need to get another 2080 Super (NVlink wouldnt work with say, a 2080 Super and a 2070).  But do the cards need to be perfectly identical?  Do they need to be made by the same manufacturer?  Are there other, subtle things I need to look out for?  Or are there no subtleties,  and ANY 2080 Super that I buy will work with the one I currently have?

I'm mainly interested in Sept. 17th launch of the 3080. My main question is, where is the best place to get it? Should I just be spamming refresh on Amazon, Newegg, EVGA website, etc.? Or is it worth trying my luck at Micro Center (\~1-2 hr drive, so if I'm going to do that I better get a card)?

I'm hoping you can help answer a question here...

So my 3x monitors are LG 27GL850-B which are 1440p 144hz via Displayport 1.4, and G-Sync compatible (not native)

The issue I have is that apparently with the G-Sync (Adaptive Sync) enabled, it is only up to a max of 100hz via HDMI, hence I'm currently running from 3x Displayport 1.4 out of my 980ti (Yes I know, not G-sync compatible...)

Seeing as the 3080/3090 only has one Displayport out, am I just shit out of luck and needing to run at max 100hz via HDMI or is there some way around this to have full 1440p 144hz goodness with all bells and whistles?

I like surround gaming, so overall I suppose I could have my primary monitor connected via DP, and the left/right on HDMI... but that might freak my brain out

Thanks!

Ps, still not decided on 3080 or 3090 because the future exists and I love VR...

I could not really find an answer to this question but reading the responses from the Q+A post there was not much reference to the capabilities of GDDR6X relating to the 10GB limit on the 3080.

nvidia,"Nvidia officially recommends 750w PSU for the 3080, as do all AIB partners. Obviously not all 750w PSUs are equal and Nvidia are likely going for the lowest common denominator, such as the average Joe with a Bronze Plus 750w PSU from 6 years ago.

Moreover, some extreme-tier 2080ti cards do consume an excess of 300 watts (such as MSI Lightning Z and Asus Rog Matrix) and nevertheless the recommended PSU is 650w even for those cards.

So my question is, would a quality (Plus Gold, all Japanese capacitors, 10y warranty) 650w PSU handle the 320w Rtx 3080?

**Edit: on the Nvidia website where the 750w PSU recommendation is stated, it also stated that it is based on a system with a 10900K, and less power might be sufficient for less power-hungry systems (the wording may vary for you, as I am translating from a foreign language what is on Nvidia's website, but you get the point).

Also, I came across a pre-built gaming PC with a 3080 and a 3700x which has paired as its PSU a ""650w Plus Bronze"" (not gonna post the store link here because I don't know whether that is against the rules or not).

All in all, I think the ultimate answer will come from tests and reviews with the 3080 itself once they are available. But in theory, a quality 650w PSU with a Ryzen 7, a Ryzen 5 or a not so power hungry Intel CPU might handle a reference or close-to-reference Rtx 3080.",Rtx 3080 on a quality 650w PSU: Good idea?,offici recommend w psu aib partner obvious w psu equal like go lowest common denomin averag joe bronz plu w psu year ago moreov extrem tier ti card consum excess watt msi lightn z asu rog matrix nevertheless recommend psu w even card question would qualiti plu gold japanes capacitor warranti w psu handl w rtx edit websit w psu recommend state also state base system k less power might suffici less power hungri system word may vari translat foreign languag websit get point also came across pre built game pc x pair psu w plu bronz gonna post store link know whether rule think ultim answer come test review avail theori qualiti w psu ryzen ryzen power hungri intel might handl refer close refer rtx rtx qualiti w psu good idea

I'm personally a fan of the ASUS ROG stuff.  I have an IX Hero right now which says is 3rd gen PCIe.

So i'm looking at their lineup of latest boards and even the highest end XII Extreme is still only 3rd Generation PCIe.

When can we expect motherboards to catch up to RTX 3000 cards being built for 4th generation PCIe?  Is there other good quality gaming motherboards that have 4th gen for Intel 10gen CPUs

&amp;#x200B;

Answer for those like me wondering why you can't find Intel board with Gen4:

Intel 10th gen CPUs don't have support for PCIe gen4 so intel mobo's only have gen3 PCIe.

Intel 11th gen CPUs are suppose to have it though.

AMD processors have had it for a while so you will find Gen4 PCIe slots on AMD mobos.  

So as of the time of the RTX 3000 card releases, AMD systems will be able to make the most out of those new GPUs.    If you're on Intel,  3000 cards will work in Gen3 ports but i'm not sure at what kind of gaming that extra bandwidth is going to matter like will it really matter for 4K or will it only matter at 8K.

Since my thought budget for a card was 700 euro tops I was very happy, however, I saw the launch price of the 3080 is just 719 euro, only 20 euro beyond my top budget. I thought to myself that if I want to upgrade, I should really take the leap, and so I think I will.

Now to the main question, I've seen the new cooling system of the founders (such an improvement) and seeing that the non premium versions of the 3rd party sellers are quite hideous, I'm most likely going to get myself the 3080 founders edition, however I don't know if mounting it vertically would negatively affect my cpu's temperature.

I'm quite concerned about this so please, feel free to leave your answer/opinion on the matter, I'll be very thankful for reading your comments.","Is it a bad idea to mount my future rtx 3080 (founders ed) vertically, taking into account the heat direction?",current upgrad pc christma everi piec updat initi aim thought price spain would get high howev result cost sinc thought budget card euro top happi howev saw launch price euro euro beyond top budget thought want upgrad realli take leap think main question seen new cool system founder improv see non premium version rd parti seller quit hideou like go get founder edit howev know mount vertic would neg affect temperatur new cool system preview redd ctbsc l png width format png auto webp c dd c cf de f e quit concern pleas feel free leav answer opinion matter thank read comment bad idea mount futur rtx founder ed vertic take account heat direct

nvidia,"Either way the difference between the two will be small (With RTX ON) and at RRP buying the 2080Ti is worse £-for-performance than the 3070 I am not suggesting otherwise. We will need to wait for benchmarks to be sure. This is all speculation. 

***Point 1.*** 2080Ti has a higher power draw with the ability to unlock and add 20% to it's power limit, you can also safely increase the core clock to around 2000-2100Mhz with memory OC being 500-800+Mhz increase (I actually got a stable +900), that is  a lot. Max temps can then increase to 88oC. The stock 3070 runs at 1500Mhz up to 1730Mhz and has a smaller compact board meaning heat is more concentrated, with the FE (and all cards) there is a chance that the improvement in heat dissipation compared to increase in heat caused by increased CUDA core count will not be equivalent to the increased heat output considering the card is also 260W compared to the 2080Ti's 280W,  it is therefore possible the 3070 could  be less overclockable.  This will affect in game performance such as FPS.

Quick math: 1.73\*5888 = 10186.24, 2.1\*4352=9139.2. A potential on paper increase of \~11% for the power output of the 3070 compared to OC 2080Ti (Yes I know that is unfair OC vs Stock) assuming all cores can run at max which is very unlikely due to thermal management. A potential point for the 3070 if it can hold its heat. I'm aware that math is not how the real calculations would be done.

***Point 2.*** Memory. 2080Ti 11GB with higher 352-bit memory interface (PCIE 3) with a bandwidth of 616GB/s VS 3070's 256-bit (PCIE 4) with a bandiwidth of 512GB/s. This is ignoring the huge memory OC you can achieve with the 2080Ti. Although most games won't get near the 11GB limit, probably not even the 8GB of the 3070, the bus speed will make a difference with loading times. If you have a pci 3.0 x16 slot, you won't be max'ing it with either card so the PCI4 slot won't make any difference over PCI\\3 for these cards as they can already transfer 16GB/s so increasing that to 32GB/s with PCI 4 will have little to no effect.

***Point 3.*** The chart. We all saw 'the chart' stating that the 3070 was the same performance as a 2080Ti. The caveat here is, RTX ON and DLSS ON. The FPS for Control went from 65fps on the 2070 to 100fps with the 3070. ([https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3070/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3070/)) The 2080Ti is much better than a 2070 so FPS would actually be a reasonable amount higher, closing that gap. Everyone saw that the 30-series is 2-3x better at Ray Tracing than the 20-series. So for those who don't use ray-tracing or for games that do not support it, it stands to reason that performance could still be better on the 2080Ti and that performance is only equivalent with RTX ON and DLSS ON. 

The 20-series struggles with Ray Tracing dropping around sometimes \~50% FPS for it, so with 2-3x improvements on RTX it is possible that RTX OFF performance will be (albeit marginally) better with the 2080Ti &gt; 3070. Don't get me wrong here, that is a massive improvement resulting in better graphics but it would appear that in theory the FPS could be similar between the two cards meaning they're only comparible because of the RTX improvements and not overall power. 

There may be other factors here that I have missed but I mainly wanted to point out the pros of 2080Ti&gt;3070, why 3070 may not be equivalent in all cases and reassure the 2080Ti owners that they're not out-of-date yet. I think the 2080Ti will still lie between 3070 and 3080 in terms of performance without RTX and with it in-line with 3070. It's just double the price... so don't buy one.

nvidia,"Is it possible to calculate/approximate a floor that these cards will hit, or if they are currently going too low in price due to panic.

For example,

A 3070 is roughly equivalent to (Better but probably by a small margin)  a 2080Ti. A 3070 costs £469. Therefore, a 2080Ti can't drop much below this, let's say £420.

A 2070 Super is around 20% slower than a 2080Ti, if we take a 20% discount on £420 we get £350.

If a 3060 came out this would of course change things further.

&amp;#x200B;

Does my assessment seem reasonable? I also think the limited stock of these new cards may preserve some 20 series value, so many people want to buy GPUs and would either accept a 2080Ti at a discount instead of a 3070, or opt for a 2070 Super as they really don't need the power a higher tier card provides and would rather save cost.

nvidia,"I am making this post in regards to the latest video by Youtube channel ""Hardware Unboxed"", titled ""How the RTX 2080 Failed Against the GTX 1080 Ti &amp; GTX 1080"". 

What I have discovered, by double checking his numbers, is that Hardware Unboxed, in my opinion, possibly with intent, skewed the results of this test to cast the 2080 in a negative light, and the 1080ti in a positive one. I have my suspicions as to why this was done, but once you see the data, one can clearly see something is ""off"". And I have proof. 

Disclaimer: I myself do own a 2080, and the card, in my opinion, not only has many shortcomings, but also does deserve a lot of criticism, and I'm fine with that. However, I feel that manipulating data and/or being disingenuous to make that point needs to be called out.

I will break down each game that he tested in his comparison that show the contradictions. Focus will be on the 4k results here.

&amp;#x200B;

(1.) Death Stranding. The 2080 is ahead of the 1080ti at 1080P and 1440P, but the gap supposedly closes at 4K. Steve then makes the claim that this is because of lack of VRAM on the 2080. This is false and misleading. VRAM has nothing to do with these results, as this game at 4K always uses far less than 8GB VRAM. In fact, the game will not even allocate extra memory like others do when extra vram is available.

(2.) Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Using data from his own 2080 Super Review, the standard 2080 was tested as being 1FPS faster than 1080ti at 4K. But now in his latest video, it's showing the 2080 as being 4FPS behind the 1080ti. So the 2080 magically lost 5 FPS in this comparison. Keep in mind that the stack is very tight in this game, so a few FPS difference is huge. Somethings way off about this result.

(3.) Gears 5. From their GeForce GTX 1080 Ti vs. 5700 XT &amp; RTX 2070 Super review, the 2070S is showed beating the 1080ti by a single FPS, but much better lows. Now, they are showing the 2080 as behind the 1080ti by 3FPS? How is that possible? Furthermore, various other sites all show the 2080 even with the 1080ti in this game, but it loses out in Hardware Unboxed test, well outside of the margin of error. Another skewed result in favor of the 1080ti.

(4.) Doom Eternal. Using data from his own Doom Eternal GPU benchmark from March shows the the 2080 getting 81FPS, versus 78FPS for the 1080ti at 4k. Now, the results are flipped, with the 1080ti well ahead by 10FPS and much better lows. Other sites who have tested Doom Eternal all show the 2080 ahead of the 1080ti at 4K. Now all of a sudden it's 10FPS behind according to his tests?

(5.) Assassins Creed Odyssey. From their own RTX 2080 Super review, he shows the 2080 as being 1 FPS faster than the 1080ti, and notice how the 2080 suddenly loses that 1FPS in his newest comparison, as they are now even. Margin of error stuff, but it is suspicious.

(6.) Hitman 2. Their own Hitman 2 57 GPU benchmark review from 2018 showed the 2080 as 66FPS versus 62FPS for the 1080ti at 4k. Now, they are even dead even according to their test. How did the 2080 lose 4FPS? Another skewed result.

https://preview.redd.it/a5bzkmd8z5l51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea179c9ef0ee94a2714075c9860524cf72b9fcf1

You will also note that they conveniently left out the two most important and popular games as of recent, that being Red Dead Redemption 2 and Modern Warfare, I theorize he did this because the 2080 massively outperforms the 1080ti in those games, and that would have massively shifted the results in favor of the 2080 even more, which is against the possible agenda I believe they had when putting forth that video.

At the end of the video he notes that when he did his original 2080 review in Sept 2018, he showed the 2080 as being 1% faster at 4K, and now two years later, his testing is showing the result to be virtually identical.

I categorically reject this. With the driver improvements we have seen since Turing's launch, and more and more games utilizing proper DX12, and more importantly, FP16 performance, the 2080 is further ahead of the 1080ti now than at launch. Techpowerup currently shows the 2080 as being around 7% faster overall, and the evidence supports this.

Furthermore, at this current time, only a few outlier games exist that REQUIRE (not allocate) more than the 8GB VRAM the 2080 has. Not to mention that the newest 3070 has the same amount of VRAM. Point being, Hardware Unboxed in a few areas tried to spin the 8GB as a limitation. Again, more disingenuousness.   

It would appear, from everything that I have seen here, that in my opinion, an effort was made to try cast the 2080 as poorly as possible by providing skewed results, and I believe this due to the upcoming 3000 series.

nvidia,"So, in my excitement to buy new cards, I realized that my case (Define C TG) has a limit of 315mm, which made me want to figure out which cards I could actually fit inside my case, but manufacturers haven't released all their dimensions yet, so I endeavored to scale their promotional images and figure out the approximate card length.

Card lengths and thickness (per manufacturers):

* Founders Edition: 285mm/2 Slot
* EVGA XC3: 285mm/2.2 Slot (45.1mm)
* EVGA FTW3: 300mm/2.75 Slot (55.55mm)
* Zotac Trinity: 318mm/2.75 slot (58mm)
* MSI Ventus: 305mm/2.75 slot (57mm)
* MSI Gaming Trio: 323mm/2.75 slot (56mm)
* MSI Gaming X Trio: 323mm/2.75 slot (56mm)
* ASUS TUF: 300mm/2.5 slot (51.8mm)
* ASUS ROG Strix: 318.5mm/2.75 Slot (57.8mm)

Card lengths based on scaled images from promotional material (obviously not 100% accurate):

* Zotac Trinity Holo: \~318mm
* Zotac AMP Extreme: \~325mm
* Gigabyte Windforce:  \~313mm
* Gigabyte Eagle: \~322mm

Hope that helps anyone else in the same situation as me.

nvidia,"Maybe I missed a monitor discussion, but buying a 3080 (or 3090) seems almost useless to me without a *good* 4k monitor.

I'm looking through monitors for sale and I feel it's extremely hard to find a 144hz monitor with stats that seem fit for gaming. Either you have to overclock most of these to hit 144(and likely cause mild visual artifacts) or you have to put them in ""fast response time"" modes which also introduces visual issues.

If HPs own website let's me put a 2080ti in an otherwise identical PC with the exact same PSU and the power draw on the 3070 is only 220w do I need to replace it before grabbing a 3070 when they come out? Everything else on the PC seems decent enough quality so I expect the PSU is and with a Ryzen 7 3700X only pulling 150w I feel like there should be plenty of power for the 3070 (or 2070/2080ti even if it's stretching it a bit much) buy I'd like some input from those of you who know more?

nvidia,"i'd like to add my little bit of anti-fuckery evangelism to this soon-to-boil kettle of hupe: the rtx 3080fe dissipates 320w, and the rtx 3090fe dissipates 350w.


the difference is only 30 watts! 30 measly watts at *full load*. the rtx 3090fe is plus sized for reasons other than getting rid of 9.4% more heat... it's just a bit more than and inch bigger in all dimensions! 25% taller, 10% longer, and 33% thicker. if a 5' 7” woman grew 24% taller, she'd be one inch shy of 7 feet tall and could claim the title of 3^rd tallest woman alive.


on nvidia's product pages, both recommend 750w power supplies, both have a max temperature of 93c, and both require a pair of 8-pin pcie power connectors.


the pcie x16 connector is rated to provide 75w, and each 8-pin pcie power connector provides 150w with 3 circuits. spec-wise, there's plenty of power.



but why does the rtx 3090fe need to be an inch taller, and inch longer, and a slot wider than the rtx 3080fe? i'm pretty sure it's not the extra 30w of power dissipation.


if you noticed, the rtx 3090fe is also the only gpu from this line with an nvlink, and none of the announced founders' edition gpus have more than 4 outputs... 3 displayport v1.4a and an hdmi v2.1 that is likely implemented internally as a dp 1.4-&gt;hdmi 2.1 converter. there would have been fanboi riots if these didn't have at least *1* hdmi 2.1 output, so nvidia was *very* careful to make sure it was implemented. i am *slightly* surprised that these weren't the first consumer implementation of displayport 2.0, and disappointed but not surprised the virtualllink port was removed.


with virtual reality growing very fast, and vr driving a fair number of higher end gpu sales, i would have thought nvidia would have kept the virtualllink port or something like it for vr. hell, a good quality usb 3.2 type a port would be fine, and a 12v output as a bonus port would have made many vr lovers swoon. i'd have loved to see a displayport and usb 3.2 port internally on these gpus, and an optional paid accessory the used them to provide a front-of-chassis ”vr port”.


what really grinds my gears is the rtx 3090 being so damn unnecessarily big. there are only 2 possible reasons for its size, and i hate both!

1. the card is huge because its physical size will appeal to ”gamers” who purchase overpriced gear that *would* have been enterprise gear if it wasn't gimped, given a ”few expenses were spared to make it look like no expense were spared” color palette and decorative plastic bits... and all the rgbling that would fit. gamers might also be dumb enough to buy two for sli over a single 25GBps each direction nvlink gimped down from the 4 or 8 the ga102. 

2. nvidia has a history of throwing hissy fits over putting consumer gpus in professional workstations, servers, or anything other than a consumer pc. they have a history of petty, annoying, and pain-in-the-ass design choices and policies to prevent this... such as putting the pcie power connectors on the *top* of the consumer gpus, thereby making a workstation fit very difficult and fitting most servers very often impossible without soldering. up until the rtx 3090fe, though, every founders' edition and nvidia produced gpu fit within the pcie sig maximum physical size specification. the rtx 3080fe fits really, really closely. the rtx 3090fe is close to exactly *one* inch bigger in each direction.


i'm pretty sure it's more #2 than #1 because quadros are traditionally between 4 and 6 time more expensive than consumer gpus with the same chip... and teslas a hell of a lot more than that, and nvidia is worried that they might not capture every single dollar.


traditionally, the top quadro gpu and the top consumer gpu and/or the titan share the same gpu and pcb. the quadro has a couple extra ram chips for ecc, larger or more ram chips as it usually has double the ram, a less tacky cooler, something physical on the card to assign its product id, and the pcie power connectors moved to the rear. often it has only a single 8-pin, as while the pcie sig says an 8-pin provides 3x 12v circuits and 150w max, even wimpy 18awg wire and molex's ratings on the minifit-jr pcie power connectors they invented are 9a per pin, so at 12v and 3 circuits can handle 324w... and most psus of sufficient capacity are single 12v rail, so aren't going to care if 324w (or more) is sent over the 8-pin pcie power connector.


the top quadro gpu is always an awesome card, and always out of my price reach. the 48gb turing rtx 8000 just went on sale for $5,500, and the 24gb rtx 6000 (same gpu, half the ram) for $4000. with this being a great sale on the previous generation top quadros, we can only guess that the ampere versions are going to be hella expensive, and very likely $4-5000 for a 24gb version. a version that is slightly faster than the rtx 3090fe in that it's a full ga102 gpu. it'l likely have ecc memory, a pcie sig spec normal size cooler, a hardware id letting the gpu know it's a quadro, 4 or 8 nvlink lanes (making multiple gpu use a useful possibly), a rear facing pcie power connector (maybe 2 this time around as ampere loves big crowds of angry pixies)... and the ungimped quadro version of the drivers.


in short, i'm calling shenanigans on the rtx 3090fe cooler and pcb size. it's bullshit, and made that way to take advantage of the rabid and uninformed ”gamer” crowd and made huge to make it impossible to fit in a rackmount server or most professional workstations.


the only saving grace here is that it will be good for ai/ml students and researchers on a tight budget, as this set of people are likely to build their own computers or purchase short run bespoke prebuilts from smaller, specialized companies... which is the only way one (or the gods forefend, a pair) of those purposefully oversized bastards will fit in a computer.



on a side note, evga looks like their hydro copper and xc3 editions of the rtx 3090 are pcie sig spec size compliant pcbs... and alohacool is rumored to make a rackmount friendly waterblock for some 3090s... so all that remains is soldering on a pigtail to not have to put the pcie power connectors on top, and it seems like it might be possible to fit a few water cooled rtx 3090s in a 3u or smaller server....

nvidia,"For someone like me who has an air cooler on their CPU, this seems like a questionable decision. If mounted normally, the CPU cooler no longer gets to take in cool air from the front of the case. If you were to set up some sort of tunnel/shroud to isolate the CPU's air supply, the GPU would be exhausting straight onto it and its cooling would suffer. Other than liquid cooling, the only option I see would be to mount the GPU vertically with a side-exhaust profile if possible, so that it takes in cool air and ejects it out the side and rear of the case. The problem here is, of course, finding a side-exhaust case. What's everyone's opinion on this choice? While I can see it improving GPU cooling, I wonder what the real-world penalties to CPU cooling ability will be.

Also, this is my own lack of understanding, but how does vertically mounting a GPU work I/O-wise?

Then theres two screenshots from both of the players POV, and in the low latencies players screenshot you can see the high frequency player, however the high frequency player ""cannot"" see the low latency one.

nvidia,"So it's looking like a 3080 is only about 10-20% less powerful than a 3090. As a Titan replacement, the 3090 is bound to be the most powerful card in this stack for the next 2 years.  When they release a 3080ti or 3080 with 20gb VRAM it won't be significantly more powerful than a 3080, like the 2080ti was to the 2080, it'll be more like a 3080 super with more VRAM.

Knowing this, it's not waiting for a card with significantly more perf to release, it's deciding if you need more VRAM.

The way I see it, if you're not gaming in 4K or super ultrawide (Samsung odyssey G9 resolution), there are essentially no use cases for above 10gb VRAM, but I'd like to ask the audience if I'm right.  I have a  2080ti, and in MSFS2020 on ultra settings at 3440x1440 I never see above 8gb useage.  In half life alyx on my valve index, it starts off at about 8gb and then gradually climbs in VRAM until it reaches a max of exactly 10gb.  I don't think it actually needs all that VRAM, but rather it starts off at 8gb which is what it needs and then uses as much as it can to a max of 10gb to keep a backlog of memory. 

Im pretty sure that in 4K you can blow right past 11gb VRAM, right?  And I'm guessing some niche cases like modding Skyrim with super textures or something.  But in regular old games, I don't see absolutely any reason to have more than 10gb VRAM.

nvidia,"Hi everyone,

Like many of you here, I watched the conference yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised with the prices, until I saw the Japanese ones here : https://www.nvidia.com/ja-jp/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/

The prices for the RTX 2000 series were already incredibly high at release:

- 2070 Super: 65,000 yen ($612) tax included
- 2080 Super: 95,000 yen ($890) tax included

Now, with the RTX 3000 series, NVIDIA Japan increased the prices by more than $200.

- 3070: 80,000 + 10% tax = 88,000 yen ($830)
- 3080: 110,000 + 10% tax = 121,000 yen ($1140)

Let's not even talk about the 3090 that will release at 230,000 + 10% tax = 253,000 yen ($2390).

nvidia,"I am kinda worried about the ""only"" 8GB GDDR6 of the RTX 3070 and would much prefer 10-12GB, given that the 2080ti, which is supposed to be replaced by said 3070 has 12GB and i just want to be safe for the next few years..

That said, i'll only play on 1080-1440p but aiming at Ultra/RTX/60fps.

Question is, is it worth it to spend 200€ more on the 3080 with 10GB? or should i get the 3070 and maybe upgrade to a SUPER/ti variant later? OR..could i just stick with the 3070 once i got it and still have a future proof GPU for major AAA titles?

Some say using triple buffering with fast sync is pointless, because fast sync already does triple buffering as part of how it works.

Others say you should have triple buffering set to ON in the nvidia control panel if you have selected fast sync right below it.

I know this will technically just add to the mixed results, but I'm hoping someone here can claim with absolute certainy that they are right.

nvidia,"As someone who was there during the GTX 1000 launch, tip #1: don't wait to get the GPU if you have the money for it.

There were people on here urging others to wait for benchmarks while ebay price gougers picked up dozens and put them up for 150% of MSRP. Don't wait for that to happen to get your card if you can afford to get it Day 1.

Tip #2: ALWAYS use the **fastest** shipping possible. I ordered my 1070 but didn't think the $30 expedited shipping would be worth it. Due to supply issues, it arrived a **MONTH** after I ordered it, and this was the norm. People got their orders cancelled by retailers after two weeks of no updates due to lack of supply, but people who were watching storefronts like hawks picked up cards the moment they arrived in stock.

Tip #3: Use stock tracking websites like  [https://www.nowinstock.net/](https://www.nowinstock.net/) to track GPU stock on multiple websites for multiple different models. This will also let you setup e-mail alerts so you know the moment the cards are in stock anywhere.

Hope that helps.

nvidia,"I've been recently trying to apply dithering to such-and-such game because it really needs it.  (Primer: You get banding in just about any game.  It can be [disguised reasonably well with dithering](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Colour_banding_example01.png).  Since no older game is suddenly going to be updated to support 10+ bit color, this is the only way to tackle this issue.)

I already figured out that ReShade's dithering is... actually just a static noise pattern plastered over the entire screen in the hopes that it somehow disguises banding, which it doesn't even.

Then I realized that the feature is probably built into one or both makers' cards.  Turns out this was a good guess.  Both AMD and Nvidia can do this.  In fact AMD apparently has a very good hardware ditherer and is championed in particular for this capability.

So here I am, scratching my head over what I'm reading about Nvidia on this topic.  According to the threads I've found, Nvidia's GPUs and/or drivers are perfectly capable of doing this.  However, getting them to actually obey this desire requires one to fiddle with their registry—a fact that was apparently only randomly and luckily discovered.  And also apparently, as of some driver a year or two back, even that option was _deliberately squashed_ by Nvidia.

What is this?

On the eve of the new GPU gen, I suddenly find this archaic consideration to be a top concern.  Clarification on my misunderstandings would be most welcome.",Hey.

# This is a big one y'all...

Over the last month or so, we've been working with the one and only /u/NV_Tim to bring an exclusive Q&amp;A to our subreddit during the Ampere RTX 30-Series launch. We've done community Q&amp;A a few times before for other launches like [Quake II RTX](https://new.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/bzq1ib/quake_ii_rtx_engineers_qa_submit_your_questions/) or the [Frames Win Games](https://new.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/em1gev/frames_win_games_qa_with_geforce_esports_product/) announcement. I believe they have added value to the community to provide some additional insights from experts inside NVIDIA on the respective topics and they have generally been received pretty well.

Today, I'm extremely excited to announce that we are hosting our biggest Q&amp;A yet:

# The GeForce RTX 30-Series Community Q&amp;A.

I am posting this thread on behalf of /u/NV_Tim for ease of moderation and administration of the Q&amp;A thread on our side. Of course as is with every Q&amp;A, this thread will be **heavily moderated.**

# [Make sure your also check out our Megathread here for detailed information on the announcements](https://new.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/iko4ir/geforce_rtx_30series_ampere_information_megathread/)

I’ll be pulling in your questions from this thread to be answered by our experts internally. And I will be posting the answers tomorrow, September 2nd throughout the day.

To manage expectations we will be able to answer questions in the following categories.

* NVIDIA RTX 30 Series GPUs 
   * Performance
   * Power
   * Founder’s Edition Design (i.e. Dual Axial Flow Through Thermals, PSU requirements)
   * GDDR6X memory
   * 8K 
   * Ray Tracing
* NVIDIA DLSS
* NVIDIA Reflex
* NVIDIA Broadcast 
* NVIDIA Machinima
* RTX IO

Please note that we will not be able to answer any questions about GPU price, NVIDIA business dealings, company secrets, drivers, tech support or NV\_Tim’s favorite hobbies (hint: gaming). 

This thread will be heavily moderated and we may not be able to answer every question, or duplicate questions.

For over two years our GeForce community team has strived to support and contribute to this wonderful subreddit community and we hope that you find this Q&amp;A to be beneficial! 

Thank you to the NVIDIA engineers and Product Managers that have given us some of their valuable time. Huge thanks as well to /u/Nestledrink and his moderator team for helping us coordinate.

Then I remembered my current 1070Ti was only a 180W card. The GTX970 I had before the 1070Ti was a 145W card, the GTX 560Ti I had before that was 170W, the 9800GTX+ before that was 141W. 

So I realized in the history of my PC gaming rigs, I never owned a card at 300+w TDP, and I felt the amount of heat from my current and past setups were already fairly significant. I can already go from sitting comfortably to sweating in my chair fairly quickly due to the heat output when playing a heavy game. So I'm a little worried if my room will be a borderline unbearable toaster with the 3080 cranking. This is without considering the temperature inside my case too...

Even the hot Fermi GTX480 was only at 250W TDP, and Titan cards were at 250W too, so it looks like unless you ran SLI at some point, most people never experienced 320W of heat output from their gfx card(s) alone.

I own a Ryzen 7 3700X (instead of the 10900K used in the presentation), I am currently thinking about what the best card would be to replace my 1070. I was sure I'd go for a 3070, but seeing these prices, I can squeeze a bit more money and go for a 3080, but that's if I use my current 650W PSU, I can't afford extra \~150€ for a new PSU this year if I want to actually use the new hardware and buy a couple games too.

Taking into account that, if I'm not mistaken, my CPU consumes a lot less that the one used for the specs, wouldn't my PSU (GQ 650W 80 Plus Gold Modular) be enough?

Just to clarify numbers:

* RTX 3070: \~550€
* RTX 3080: \~750€
* RTX 3080 + New PSU: \~900€

550€ is no problem right now. 750€ is....expensive, but I can afford it without too many sacrifices and seems worth it, 900€ is one step higher and it'd be out of reach for me for now.

nvidia,"Since we don't have details, this is entirely guesswork, but obviously we've seen a trend over the past 10 years of releasing PCI standards before they saturate the bandwidth, even now 5000 series cards with AMD don't benefit from 4.0 vs 3.0, and even dropping 3.0 to x8 rarely sees more than 3% fps different over 3.0x16, with a 2080ti.

However with Nvidia introducing a GPU-based decompression of SSD information, does anyone else think the bandwidth of PCI 4.0, which is 2x 3.0 (for the same lane width) is going to lead to a performance hit running at 3.0?

What i'm saying, is Does anyone think we are going to actually see PCI 4.0 bandwidth data movement between SSD decompression, Frame delivery to CPU for post processing, and then out the IO?

Intel currently only supports PCI 3.0 on LGA 1200, which is more of a 'placeholder' until the new chips in 2021, but as someone looking for a new CPU/mobo, I'm worried that NVME 3.0 x4 combined with PCIE 3.0 bandwidth is going to butcher this feature.

nvidia,"The reason SLI is so bad is because it doesn't actually combine the 2 GPUs into a single giant GPU with shared memory, it uses other methods that don't scale linearly. But with NVLink you can actually share memory at a very decent speed. The A100 has NVLink that supports 600 Gbps. I know that's enterprise, but still can't you bring some of that down into the consumer space? Even at half the bandwidth of on-card memory, you can still share memory between cards at decent speeds and get 70-80% scaling that is guaranteed for every title because you effectively have double the shader/RT/tensor cores and double the memory or in essence one giant card, and in fact it could be treated as such by the driver.

nvidia,"For the first time in almost a decade, the RTX 2000 series brought a true visual fidelity game-changer to gaming: ray tracing.

The RTX 2000 series dedicated a lot of the transistor budget to RT cores. They could have used those transistors for more traditional shader cores and gotten much more traditional rendering performance. But we wouldn't have the giant leap in visual fidelity with more traditional shader cores. I'm glad Nvidia had the balls to do this 2 years ago, and now we all benefit with PS5/XSX ray tracing and Ampere ray tracing.

Next, a huge amount of transistor is dedicated to the tensor cores, which enables DLSS 2.0. In the near future, every benchmark will have to factor in DLSS because it will become the standard for any AAA game. So could Nvidia have said forget the tensor cores, let's just add more shader cores instead? Sure, they could have. But they knew tensor cores would increase performance more than adding additional shader cores as soon as devs start using it.

Xbox Series X's APU (GPU, Zen2 CPU, Audio, decode chip) has a total of 15.3b transistors. 2080Ti as a GPU alone has 18.6b.

In conclusion, 2080ti could have dedicated all of its silicon budget to normal shader cores and blew the 1080ti away, but instead, it used those transistors to introduce two revolutionary features that will define the next 20 years.

nvidia,"I am impressed, at least on, that the new 3000 series are significantly improved on previous 2000 generations and at THAT price point.

It makes sense that people would sell their old cards and use it towards their new cards. Now with the insane 30xx pricing, how low will the 20xx or even 10xx go? Right now on ebay 2080ti are priced around £700-800. For that price, you could get a brand new 3080 for £700 for double the performance!

My guess is that previous generations would fall by at least 50% as the 3070 would probably be priced at £500. According to the chart, the 3070 outperforms the 2080ti.

nvidia,"**Premise of the post:**

Now you might be typing ""upgrade every generation, I'm not Bill Gates. Have you lost your mind?"" To that I say possibly but in this case I think I have a good point to prove and I'm going to demonstrate multiple things:

* future proofing doesn't work. 
* upgrading every two years is not expensive.
*  the way we think of hardware is silly and we should upgrade more often, not less.

I promise, I don't work for Nvidia.

**Scenario 1 - you buy a 3090 and plan to keep it until the 5000 series:** 

* 20% better performance &amp; massively improved VRAM which if you don't know that you need it then you probably won't within two years. 
* -$800 value after 2 years.  - assumes resale at current Ebay minimum price of $700. The 4070 WILL equal or beat your card for $500-600, keep that in mind.
* Outdated card, still fine but no longer ""OMG."" Now the 3090 looks insane, two years from now it'll look like what the 2080Ti does today.
* Minimum cost after two years: $800
* Cost if upgrade to 80 series: $1500
* Cost if upgrade to 90 series: $2300

**Scenario 2 - you buy a 3080 right now (ti/s prices/specs aren't released but they MAY be good purchases.)**

* Baseline flagship performance for 2 years.
* -225$ value after 2 years. - assumes resale at current Ebay minimum price of $525 minus $50 since it's not going to be a super/ti and the current listing is.)
* -800$ to upgrade to the baseline flagship.
* Minimum cost after two years: $225
* Cost if upgrade to 80 series: $925

Now I know someone is going to argue ""well sell the 90 before the launch announcement, duh!"" That's a fair point and I agree. Ultimately this is not a debate about which card to purchase, this post is about why you should upgrade every generation and not look to future proof by purchasing insanely marked up cards to keep for years. You can do the same thing with the 90 series but it's riskier and you'll have to sell sooner.

Funfact: $/year to upkeep an 80 series GPU is $112.50 or $9.50/month using the current prices (this is selling your 80 series AFTER the launch announcement, not before which will yield even better results.) The upfront cost is high, the net cost over several years (including resale value) is about the same as you spend on Netflix or Starbucks. If you upgrade your major components each generation and have a top of the line system you can expect to spend $15/month to upkeep it, $20/month at most. Of course some components like the CPU do not need to be upgraded every generation for gaming but it's a point worth making regardless.

I said that I'd demonstrate that future proofing doesn't work as well. That's as simple as stating the obvious: 20% performance over the current gen 80 series is not enough to future proof against 70-80% increased performance as well as the new features, 24/7 warranty, newer I/O and so on. **In two years, relatively speaking your 3080, your 3090 and your 3090 Ti Super Titan Strix Super Dupah will suck.**",You should upgrade every generation - here's why!,premis post might type upgrad everi gener bill gate lost mind say possibl case think good point prove go demonstr multipl thing futur proof work upgrad everi two year expens way think hardwar silli upgrad often less promis work scenario buy plan keep seri better perform massiv improv vram know need probabl within two year valu year assum resal current ebay minimum price equal beat card keep mind outdat card still fine longer omg look insan two year look like ti today minimum cost two year cost upgrad seri cost upgrad seri scenario buy right ti price spec releas may good purchas baselin flagship perform year valu year assum resal current ebay minimum price minu sinc go super ti current list upgrad baselin flagship minimum cost two year cost upgrad seri know someon go argu well sell launch announc duh fair point agre ultim debat card purchas post upgrad everi gener look futur proof purchas insan mark card keep year thing seri riskier sell sooner funfact year upkeep seri month use current price sell seri launch announc yield even better result upfront cost high net cost sever year includ resal valu spend netflix starbuck upgrad major compon gener top line system expect spend month upkeep month cours compon like need upgrad everi gener game point worth make regardless said demonstr futur proof work well simpl state obviou perform current gen seri enough futur proof increas perform well new featur warranti newer two year rel speak ti super titan strix super dupah suck upgrad everi gener
nvidia,"I wasn't, I thought I understood it perfectly, but then I bought a 4k TV. 

I have a 165hz 1440p G-sync display, if I want to downsample, and I go to 4k, it looks terrible. I understand this is because it's the wrong integer (or...so I thought) but, if I downsample to 5k it looks _absolutely incredible_ but I only have a 1080 TI so for obvious reasons, it's not always possible. Of course, finding custom resolutions isn't the problem here. 

As I _thought_ I understood it, it should be:

720p -&gt; 1440p - 5k. 

Or 1080p -&gt; 4k -&gt; 8k I guess. 

Yet, AFAIK 720, 1080, 1440p etc are all 16:9 aspect ratios, correct?

So I always thoughty 4k looked _worse_ than native 1440p on the monitor, yet 5k looks absolutely beautiful because as I said, I put it down to the wrong integer and didn't need to really fuss as to why. (Likewise, dropping to 1080p looked terrible, but 720p looked...well, still terrible because it's 720p, but ""not wrong"" terrible if that makes sense. 

Then I bought a 4k TV and everything confused me. 1080p on the 4k TV looks great, it's a Bravia so it has built in upscaling with X reality pro, but it surprised me at just _how_ good it looked (At least, for gaming (and streaming YT/Netflix etc) but watching terrestrial television channels looks horrific unless they're HD and my old 1080p TV looked fantastic, in fact it's one of the best pictures I've ever seen but that's going off point, and it needs repair) 

The thing is, dropping to 1440p _still_ looks incredible. It looks correct, there's no apparent aliasing like going from 1440p - 4k on my monitor (RoG Swift PG278QR) and while smoothness helps somewhat, it still looks worse than native, so no point. 

So unless the Bravia's upscaling technique is magical (which, I don't put it down to that) what is going on? Why does 1440p look amazing on my TV, while if I upscale on my Monitor, it doesn't - and bear in mind, the monitor _at the time_ was one of the best, while my TV is, well decent but I don't think the same level as the monitor. 

Sorry, I am terrible at explaining! My monitor looks great at 1440 and 5k. 1080p &amp; 4k look terrible. My 4k TV looks great at 1080p (which, is the correct integer) but also 1440p which, AFAIK shouldn't, and I don't ""think"" X-reality Pro would work for that?",I'm confused about graphic scaling.,thought understood perfectli bought k tv hz p g sync display want downsampl go k look terribl understand wrong integ thought downsampl k look absolut incred ti obviou reason alway possibl cours find custom resolut problem thought understood p p k p k k guess yet afaik p etc aspect ratio correct alway thoughti k look wors nativ p monitor yet k look absolut beauti said put wrong integ need realli fuss likewis drop p look terribl p look well still terribl p wrong terribl make sens bought k tv everyth confus p k tv look great bravia built upscal x realiti pro surpris good look least game stream yt netflix etc watch terrestri televis channel look horrif unless hd old p tv look fantast fact one best pictur ever seen go point need repair thing drop p still look incred look correct appar alias like go p k monitor rog swift pg qr smooth help somewhat still look wors nativ point unless bravia upscal techniqu magic put go p look amaz tv upscal monitor bear mind monitor time one best tv well decent think level monitor sorri terribl explain monitor look great k p k look terribl k tv look great p correct integ also p afaik think x realiti pro would work confus graphic scale

nvidia,"Hi guys/gals,

I have an issue. I generally know that when you use dual monitors the GPU works faster therefore a bit higher temps.

But...

Lately I was playing as usual on my bigger 2560x1440 while the other 1920x1080 was just on. I played kinda old games like Splinter's Cell Blacklist but on DX9 so it wasn't much for the RTX 2070. Unfortunately the GPU temps ranged from 60-75 Celsius. The funny thing is that when I launched it the other time the GPU temps were 40-50  C while still on the same setup (meaning 1920x1080 monitor just on, same maps, same settings). And here comes my question:

Is there a way to have both monitors on but to let system/GPU know that it should use only its working power on the main with a game? 

PS.

I think that my general GPU temps are a bit higher that they should be because of this strange coputational power.

nvidia,"nvidia always have had very poor launches. you usually have to either wait 3 months to get them at MRSP, or buy from scalpers at crazily inflated price.

judging from the high demand for 3080, i wouldnt be surprised if they'd for sale for $900 from scalpers during the first 30 days of the launch. and some people would still buy them coz they think its cheaper than 2080ti...

such things happened with pascal (i couldnt get 1080 at MRSP at all, UNTIL, 1080ti came out, at which point i just bought 1080ti instead). it happened to a lesser extent with 980ti. it happend with 2080 and 2070. and it will happen with 3080, and maybe 3070 as well.

So you're looking at late November to get 3080. At that point, the scalping activities will finally cool down as the early adopters have had bought most of the overpriced GPUs. And even then, the big retailers (such as Amazon, Newegg) gonna sell them at $800. Even blower type and reference type cooler designs gonna sell at $800. 

Because during Pascal launch, which was when Nvidia first introduced Founders edition, the FE was supposed to command a premium over regular AIBs. Instead, the FE's price became the floor. Even reference designs from AIBs end up either at or above the FE price. The same gonna happen with the 30 series.

nvidia,"Comparing Graphics cards just based on the naming scheme is absolutely worthless. We shouldn't compare a 1080ti (699 MSRP) to a 2080ti (1200 MSRP) We should compare generations based on the price point. 

For example, we should compare the 1070ti (399 MSRP) to the 2060/super (399 MSRP) and compare that jump in performance, to the 2070 super (499 MSRP) compared to Ampere 3070 (499 MSRP). To contextualize how big of a jump ampere really is from its predecessor. 

The 2060 super was around a 25% improvement from its price point predecessor the 1070ti at (399 MSRP) 

Assuming that NVIDIA's benchmarks are fair, the 3070 is set out to be around 40% faster from its price point match, the 2070/s at (499 MSRP).

That is just based on pure rasterization, not mentioning software and hardware improvements.

DLSS is set out to be much faster, and much more efficient, Ray Tracing is set out to be way less taxing on GPU performance than the last generation, Ampere is also more power-efficient than Turing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you can only view this from two different perspectives. Either Turing was undoubtedly bad, which makes Ampere look very good, or that Ampere is really good, that it makes Turing look awful. 

Either way, it's all the same. It just means that this new generation is a big jump, a much bigger jump than the past generation, not only in performance but in software and hardware as well.",Is Ampere really that good?,compar graphic card base name scheme absolut worthless compar ti msrp ti msrp compar gener base price point exampl compar ti msrp super msrp compar jump perform super msrp compar amper msrp contextu big jump amper realli predecessor super around improv price point predecessor ti msrp assum benchmark fair set around faster price point match msrp base pure raster mention softwar hardwar improv dlss set much faster much effici ray trace set way less tax perform last gener amper also power effici ture x b well view two differ perspect either ture undoubtedli bad make amper look good amper realli good make ture look aw either way mean new gener big jump much bigger jump past gener perform softwar hardwar well amper realli good

nvidia,"Hi

So, I’ve got a new PC being built right now. Because I know very little about tech nor do I follow any tech channels, I was in the dark about the 3000 series. Then I open reddit, see what’s happened, and apply clown makeup. 

But

I don’t have the money to get a 30__ and I really can’t be fucked selling my 2070s for little return

My question is, with this new release, is it still a good choice? Will I still perform well on new games coming out?

I know that a new card coming out doesn’t make others obsolete instantly. This is Nvidia, not Apple. But it’s still a worry of mine, with how the internet likes to exaggerate everything.

nvidia,"So I am looking for laptop, and have unlimited budget. I have to spend it until end of April 2021.

Don't want this to be another ""when will RTX 30xx come to laptop"" posts, but I am trying to make the most educated purchase, considering budget.

I'm a tech noob, but am aware of TB3 bottleneck with regards to GPU performance. How do you see new cards working with EGPU setup, and is there any foreseen improvements on that front?

If  you wonder, I need the laptop because of meetings outside the office, but also want to game occasionally, and EGPU allows me to use 30xx series GPU. Since I won't be able to buy a 30xx in a laptop by April 2021., EGPU seems like an option to me.

# Other Features and Technologies:

* **NVIDIA Reflex**
   * NVIDIA Reflex is a new suite of technologies that optimize and measure system latency in competitive games.
   * It includes:
      * **NVIDIA Reflex Low-Latency Mode,** a new technology to reduce game and rendering latency by up to 50 percent.  Reflex is being integrated in top competitive games including Apex Legends, Fortnite, Valorant, Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Destiny 2, and more.
      * **NVIDIA Reflex Latency Analyzer**, which detects clicks coming from the mouse and then measures the time it takes for the resulting pixels (for example, a gun muzzle flash) to change on screen.  Reflex Latency Analyzer is integrated in new 360Hz NVIDIA G-SYNC Esports displays and supported by top esports peripherals from ASUS, Logitech, and Razer, and SteelSeries.
      * Measuring system latency has previously been extremely difficult to do, requiring over $7,000 in specialized high-speed cameras and equipment.
* **NVIDIA Broadcast**
   * New AI-powered Broadcast app
   * Three key features:
      * **Noise Removal:** remove background noise from your microphone feed – be it a dog barking or the doorbell ringing. The AI network can even be used on incoming audio feeds to mute that one keyboard-mashing friend who won’t turn on push-to-talk.
      * **Virtual Background:** remove the background of your webcam feed and replace it with game footage, a replacement image, or even a subtle blur. 
      * **Auto Frame:** zooms in on you and uses AI to track your head movements, keeping you at the center of the action even as you shift from side to side. It’s like having your own cameraperson.
* **RTX I/O**
   * A suite of technologies that enable rapid GPU-based loading and game asset decompression, accelerating I/O performance by up to 100x compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs
   * When used with Microsoft’s new DirectStorage for Windows API, RTX IO offloads up to dozens of CPU cores’ worth of work to your RTX GPU, improving frame rates, enabling near-instantaneous game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games.
* **NVIDIA Machinima**
   * Easy to use cloud-based app provides tools to enable gamers’ creativity, for a new generation of high-quality machinima.
   * Users can take assets from supported games, and use their web camera and AI to create characters, add high-fidelity physics and face and voice animation, and publish film-quality cinematics using the rendering power of their RTX 30 Series GPU
* **G-Sync Monitors**
   * Announcing G-Sync 360 Hz Monitors
* **RTX Games**
   * Cyberpunk 2077
      * New 4K Ultra Trailer with RTX
   * Fortnite
      * Now adding Ray Tracing, DLSS, and Reflex
   * Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War
      * Now adding Ray Tracing, DLSS, and Reflex

# Basic Community FAQ

**When is Preorder**

There is no preorder.

**What are the power requirements for RTX 30 Series Cards?**

RTX 3090 = 750W Required

RTX 3080 = 750W Required

RTX 3070 = 650W Required

Lower power rating might work depending on your system config. Please check with your PSU vendor.

**Will we get the 12-pin adapter in the box?**

Yes. Adapters will come with Founders Edition GPUs. Please consult the following chart for details.

[Image Link - GeForce RTX 3090 and 3080 Founders Edition Power and Case Requiremen](https://preview.redd.it/zaz57oacflk51.jpg?width=2525&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c93d7a7a7eb33889d897e0776a1f7c369eaa19)

**Do the new RTX 30 Series require PCIE Gen 4? Do they support PCIE Gen 3? Will there be major performance impact for gaming?**

RTX 30 Series support PCIE Gen 4 and backwards compatible with PCIE Gen 3. System performance is impacted by many factors and the impact varies between applications. The impact is typically less than a few percent going from a x16 PCIE 4.0 to x16 PCIE 3.0. CPU selection often has a larger impact on performance.

**Does the RTX 30 Series support SLI?**

Only RTX 3090 support SLI configuration

**Will I need PCIE Gen 4 for RTX IO?**

Per Tony Tamasi from NVIDIA:

*There is no SSD speed requirement for RTX IO, but obviously, faster SSD’s such as the latest generation of Gen4 NVMe SSD’s will produce better results, meaning faster load times, and the ability for games to stream more data into the world dynamically. Some games may have minimum requirements for SSD performance in the future, but those would be determined by the game developers. RTX IO will accelerate SSD performance regardless of how fast it is, by reducing the CPU load required for I/O, and by enabling GPU-based decompression, allowing game assets to be stored in a compressed format and offloading potentially dozens of CPU cores from doing that work. Compression ratios are typically 2:1, so that would effectively amplify the read performance of any SSD by 2x.*

**Will I get a bottleneck from xxx CPU?**

If you have any modern multi-core CPU from the last several years, chances are you won't be bottlenecked but it depends on the game and resolution. The higher resolution you play, the less bottleneck you'll experience.

**Compatibility - NVIDIA Reflex, RTX IO, NVIDIA Broadcast**

*NVIDIA Reflex* \- GeForce GTX 900 Series and higher are supported

*RTX IO* \- Turing and Ampere GPUs

*NVIDIA Broadcast* \- Turing (20-Series) and Ampere GPUs

**Will there be 3090 Ti/Super, 3080 Ti/Super, 3070 Ti/Super**

Literally nobody knows.

**Where will I be able to purchase the card on release date?**

The same place where you usually buy your computer parts. Founders Edition will also be available at NVIDIA Online Store and Best Buy if you're in the US.

**When can I purchase the card?**

6am PST on release day per NV\_Tim

**How much are the cards?**

3070 - $499 MSRP

3080 - $699 MSRP

3090 - $1499 MSRP

No Founders Edition  Premium

nvidia,"I think its safe to say a lot of people will be upgrading to the 30 series in the next few months. Some people will wait for reviews and benchmarks, but if you have a 20 series card like me, you want to buy into the 30 series at launch to be able to sell your old card before it completely loses value.

So in this panic of trying to organise getting a 30 series card at launch I fell down a wormhole of ""FE vs Third party"", 12pin vs dual 8pin"", ""good customer service vs bad customer service"" etc. Some of these things are important to know and others will keep you up at night wondering if you picked the right card. I wanted to highlight a couple of points I came across while asking around about the new cards.

&amp;#x200B;

* Founders Edition cards are not reference cards this time around
* FE cards will likely be some of the cheaper cards, but nvidia sub-contract their customer service and if you have any issues or reasons for RMA their customer service is traditionally very poor
* Third party cards will launch same day and time as FE cards **- Not ALL third party cards but a lot seem to be. Will include a link to provide solid evidence if found. - They will release at 2pm BST, 6am PT on Sept 17th.**
* Third party cards usually have preferred cooling solutions, but the FE have a unique cooling set up this time around so maybe a smaller difference here, time will tell
* The FE cards have a 12pin input. There will be a dual 8pin to 12pin cable provided in the box for your PSU
* The Asus ROG Strix requires three 8pin PCIE inputs, make sure you have this on your PSU **- Third 8pin may be found to be optional, waiting for reviews to confirm**
* EVGA apparently have extremely good track record with build quality, longevity and customer service **- This has been highlighted 10 fold in the comments.**
* There are lots of card manufacturers you may not have heard of before if you're new to this. Zotac, PNY, Colorful iGame, Palit etc. Does anyone have more specific experiences with these brands as I haven't dealt with them before. **- Most third parties are manufactured in Taiwan, except Colorful it seems. Taiwan manufactured cards seem to be more reliable.**
* **Best Buy seem to have the FE listed in the US, it may be smart to buy the card here and dealing with their returns policy over directly communicating with Nvidia's poor customer service. Depends on Best Buy returns policy which you should confirm yourself.**
* **650W should be fine for most people. Use** [**https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator**](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) **to confirm your PC's power usage.**
* **3070 only uses one 8pin connector**

These are just some points I've come across. I'd love for people to add more points in the comments, mostly revolving around all the different variations of the 30 series cards. What I means by that is Asus having Dual vs Tuf Gaming vs ROG Strix, what are the main differences? If they are all a 3080 card say will there really be much difference between the cards, besides cooling and overclocking say? Are there major differences between the different third party manufacturers?

Any other experiences, tips, highlights I think will help people a lot.

I built my system when the 1000 series launched. I got a 1070 and upgraded to the 1080Ti as I was able to get close to retail when I sold my card. 

My card is still solid and my rug runs everything I throw at it from Red Dead to Star Citizen to the latest Total War games.

I would like to play Cyberpunk 2077 at the highest settings but the cost would be more than the card as my Z170 board would need to be upgraded, as well as my i7-6700k.

nvidia,"So take this information with a huge grain of salt. Just because the response was “I don’t know” means they’re probably being truthful, but also might mean they aren’t authorized to know anything. I hope this helps!

I emailed Zotac, Asus, Gigabyte, and EVGA about when their RTX 3090’s (didn’t ask about the 3080 or 3070) might be available in the USA. I went to the contact pages of the sites and tried looking for sales contacts. Sometimes those links sent me to general customer service. I didn’t ask about publishing their responses, so to be safe, I redacted names. Here’s what I received:

What I'm curious about discussing is how we are all interpreting the new 3090 dynamic. With Nvidia stating the 3080 is the hero card, and the 3090 is more of a Titan competitor, how is this influencing your choices?


What has me a bit stuck on is if the 3090 is more of a Titan replacement, for creators and AI developers etc, then why are we seeing AIBs now creating versions of the 3090? Nvidia themselves are also pushing it as a gaming product on their online publications. As such, shouldn't the 3090 really be the hero gaming product?

I'm sure all would be answered with benchmarks etc. But is anyone else like me feeling a little confused about what they should be doing with their cash? Does the 3090, like the Titan RTX, represent the top performance regardless of future Ti / Super releases.

nvidia,"On the one hand, this is a very powerful 2080 Ti level graphics card. On the other hand, only 8 GB of video memory. I'm afraid that I simply won't be able to set the maximum settings in 4k games, because I will always get stutters and FPS drops due to the out of VRAM. If so, what is the point of such power? Is it worth it then to take 3080, of which 10 GB already look more or less comfortable, although there are games that can use more than 10 GB of memory. Or is it better to wait for the 3070 TI / Super release, but will there be any and if so, when. It literally torments me. Why can't I just go buy a graphics card and enjoy it with nvidia deciding to drastically cut the VRAM of 3070-3080 graphics cards. Do they really think that 8 GB is enough for video cards of this capacity? Apex Legends consumes 8+ GB, WarZone - 10+ GB. Many singles games can easily exceed 8+ GB in 4k as well.

My personal goal is to get the maximum settings in 4k, albeit with 40-50 frames, the main thing is without statters and FPS drops, so I would prefer 3070 TI / Super 16 GB for a more moderate price.

nvidia,"The ASUS Strix is specifically described as having ""up to 400W of total board power to play with."" [https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-graphics-cards/introducing-geforce-rtx-3070-rtx-3080-rtx-3090-rog-asus/]
It achieves this by using 3x8-pins, and intentionally bypassing the 75w power available via the PCI slot itself. Technically 3x8pin alone could provide 450w (150w each), but Asus appears to have chosen to limit that to 400w, probably via their vBIOS.

Do we have any similar info for other AIBs? Should we assume that other AIBs that have stated using 3x8pins will use those 3 PLUS the PCI slot power delivery? For a potential max of 525w? 

In previous gens, cards with 2x8-pin used the theoretical max of 375w (example FTW3 Ultra where the vBIOS allowed power limit to go to 373w). I don't exactly understand ASUS's reasoning behind bypassing the PCI slot, and I'd wonder if others will follow suit or gain an inherit advantage by maximizing their power delivery.

1) Is the packaging and delivery reliable, secure? Should i worry about getting my new GPU in broken package in 3 pieces? Is there a possibility they lose my package?
2) How complicated is the RMA process? Im from the Czech Republic and i guess I'll have to fill out some forms, then mail it somewhere, wait a lot of time... is it really worth the risk?

nvidia,"I'm just reading about some 2k and 4k resolutions as most people play (of course I respect it) but my current goal on the BENQ xl2546 240hz is to switch from GTX 1060 to RTX 3070, I somehow managed to push GTX 1060 through that 20xx series and now I want to buy GPU again.

By the way, I'm a guy who always plays 1080p or lower resolutions in all low settings and I'm not interested in RTX or anything like that so the game looks better to me, I'm just aiming for FPS. So RTX 3070 with i5 9600k 5.1GHz should be I think really good upgrade in my case because currently GTX 1060 (6gb) bothers me in games like BF5, Warzone where I'm at around 135fps max in 1080p, while I was looking at benchmarks where people with RTX 2080 and a worse processor than mine have about 220fps all at low settings in same games on 1080p.

Any suggestions you guys have?  I really think RTX 3070 would be perfect for guy like me who likes all low settings in Multiplayer games and maybe all high when playing Singleplayer games at 1080p only?

nvidia,"Hi all, I've got a fairly broad question with regards to RTX. I currently have a GTX 980 and a LG IPS29UM67-P monitor, which I've been using for the better part of 5 years, however, seeing the 30 series has made me want to upgrade to RTX (I'm undecided between the 3070 and 3080). My question is:

1. will my current monitor be able to display ray tracing effects? Will all the fancy lighting still be visible with my current monitor, or do I actually need to upgrade to a 4k monitor to be able to see any difference? and
2. if i do need to upgrade my monitor, what are the minimum specifications required of the monitor to display ray tracing effects? I mean in terms of refresh rate, resolution etc. 

To be clear, I am not asking what the best monitor is, or what the best resolution for RTX is. If the answer is that my current monitor will display a more refined picture in a game that has RTX, using a RTX 3070 as opposed to my current GTX 980, then it would be great if someone could please confirm whether this is the case.",Minimum monitor specifications required to experience RTX,hi got fairli broad question regard rtx current gtx lg ip um p monitor use better part year howev see seri made want upgrad rtx undecid question current monitor abl display ray trace effect fanci light still visibl current monitor actual need upgrad k monitor abl see differ need upgrad monitor minimum specif requir monitor display ray trace effect mean term refresh rate resolut etc clear ask best monitor best resolut rtx answer current monitor display refin pictur game rtx use rtx oppos current gtx would great someon could pleas confirm whether case minimum monitor specif requir experi rtx

nvidia,"This is my fist post, so I apologize if it does not belong here, but I'll get into my questions.

May 2019 I decided that I wanted to build my first PC ever, and went all out on parts. I ended up finishing the PC almost 1 year ago exactly. With the 3090 revealed, I am preparing my PC for the upgrade. Before I build it down on the 24th, I wanted a lot of your feedback and opinions on somethings that maybe I could improve on when I put the 3090 in.

\- With my custom loop, and two radiators, is it normal that my temps get up to about 58c, when playing 4k, mostly max settings, on my 2080ti? I just feel like those temps are high, and if not, what is the danger zone for temps?

\- Do you think my fan placement is problematic? I have 3 fans on the front, and a 3 fan radiator on the side. Do you think the cold air being brought in is being pulled right back out instantly?

\- Why is my coolant always at that level? I haven't found a leak in the years it's been up and running, but every time i fill up the reservoir, it goes down to that level after about a week, and stays there. Has happened 3 times now, so I just keep it at that level.

\- Any tips on draining this thing, other just pray? I made the mistake of not putting in a valve at the lowest point, so I'll take any tips regarding getting all the liquid out.

My build has the following:

\- EVGA 2080ti FTW3 ULTRA

\- i9-9900k

\- G.SKILL TridentZ (4x8GB)

\- MSI Z390 Godlike

\- ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ

I just want to enjoy playing games, like Cyberpunk 2077, in 4k, max settings, with high framerates, or as close to this goal as possible. Thank you

nvidia,"So guys,

i was just thinking about the used market for gpus. Saw a lot of posts of 2080 ti below 500$ on ebay. But how about the other cards. Well i wrote down the price of the FE of all the 20xx card the day before the presentation as reported on the nvidia website as you can see from the picture.

Also i put a column with the % of price of each card with the 2080 Ti. Next step is try to understand the value of an used 2080Ti. Let's assume that the speed is the same of the 3070 but there are less features so people will not pay the same money but a little bit less. Also let's keep in mind the card is 2 years old so in average it should be 1 year plus old (i think the amount of people buying the 2080 Ti from june 2020 was much less than any other month before as the 30xx was in the air). So i assumed 400 dollars should be a fair assumption. If you use the same proportion on the prices compared with the new cards you will see in the third column the calculated values for the other 3 cards. Next thing to consider is that the 2080 Ti was overpriced probably. So i assumed that am used 2080 super fair price today would be not 273$ but 100$ less than an used 2080 Ti. And then i calculated the other 2 values using the price of the 2080 Super as base.

I think these are fair assumptions at least until the 3060 and the equivalent of the 1660 super are presented.

What do you guys think?

nvidia,"#Purpose

Since the unveiling of Ampere I've seen a lot of contradictory and incorrect statements regarding the generation-over-generation performance changes. The key statement I'm seeing is a variation of ""Turing's performance gain was smaller than normal, and Ampere is a return to normal."" This actually hasn't been the case, and I want to highlight that with actual data.

So the purpose is to better educate users on the generation-over-generation performance gains from Nvidia's product stack.

#Methodology

There is no perfect way to do this. But I am going to try to do this as fairly as possible, and to go as far back as possible. Here are the key points to my methodology.

* Performance data will be used from [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/). Why? They've provided consistently good data for years, they compare numerous GPUs in each review, and they use geometric mean as their performance average, with that average taken from a buttload of games, not just the 3-5 in standard reviews.
* Because multiple resolutions are tested, I will use the data from the highest resolution tested as a means to reduce the impact of CPU bottlenecks on the data. **For those who saw my smaller charts as comments in the prior threads, I was previously using mid-resolutions, which were more subject to CPU bottlenecks. This is why the data looks slightly different.**
* Performance gains will be expressed over the prior marketed generation. IE, even though they are both Fermi, I will treat the 400 and 500 series as separate generations because that is how Nvidia marketed them.
* I will use the x60, x70, and x80 products, as they have been a mainstay since Fermi. I will not use Ti, Super, or Titan products as they have been inconsistently placed throughout Nvidia's history.
* If a product was offered in multiple memory configurations, I will try to use either the launch-day config (IE, GTX 1060 6GB), or the larger config if launched on the same day (IE, GTX 960 4GB).
* Reference results will be used (and that means FE results once those became Nvidia's ""reference,"" even though technically a few 20-series FEs were overclocked above official reference spec).

#Flaws in the Methodology

* One could argue that Fermi (400/500 series) and Kepler (600/700 series) should each be treated as one generation, IE, the 480 and 580 could be treated like the 2080 and 2080 Super. This is a valid viewpoint, but I felt that treating them as the separate generations that Nvidia marketed them as would be the most fair way to do it.
* By limiting myself to just Techpowerup, I am limiting myself to one source. And like any popular tech review source, it will have its fans and critics. There will be people who feel that my entire post is invalid for using them. All that I can say is that every tech reviewer has flaws, and TPU has been one of the most consistently good sources of this kind of data for a long time. Aggregating their data for this post made it easier and, actually, feasible.
* The numbers reflect the launch state of a GPU over the existing state of a prior GPU. So, the GTX 1080 over 980 numbers reflect a fresh GTX 1080 on launch drivers against a mature GTX 980 that is probably further ahead of the 780 than it was at its launch. Due to this, you should not be using these numbers to calculate cumulative gains from Fermi through Turing as you will be missing the driver-based gains between launches.

#Generational Gains - x60, x70, and x80

Note: The 400 series is reflecting performance gains over the 200 series. There was only a GTX 260 and 280, no GTX 270. (Yes, I'm aware of the 275/285 refreshes)

Series|x60|x70|x80
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
400-Series|+15.38%|N/A|+56.25%
500-Series|+19.05%|+25.00%|+16.28%
600-Series|+41.15%|+36.99%|+29.87%
700-Series|+25.00%|+13.64%|+26.58%
900-Series|+11.11%|+41.18%|+31.58%
10-Series|**+104.08%**|**+66.67%**|**+69.49%**
20-Series|+56.25%|+33.33%|+31.58%
AVERAGE|+38.86%|+36.14%|+37.38%

##Generational Gains - Anomalies in the above data.

* TPU's GTX 660 review did not include a GTX 560 for comparison. As such, I had to use two reviews to extrapolate the data.
* TPU only reviewed the 2GB variant of the GTX 960. However, especially at launch, there was no performance difference between the two cards based on most review sources.

##Generational Gains - Analysis


Looking at this reminds me of the targeted pay raises you'd see in milpay charts. It's clear that rather than going for a uniform generational increase, Nvidia had targeted increases for specific reasons. For example, the GTX 970 was insanely popular. Why? It was very close to 980 performance, but $220 cheaper. It was FAR ahead of the 960 in performance, but only $100 more expensive than the 4GB variant. The 970 was the most logical choice for prospective 900-series owners. Nvidia corrected this by narrowing the 1060/1070 performance gap (the 960 --&gt; 1060 upgrade path was a greatest generation-over-generation improvement I've seen since the Voodoo 2). The RTX 2060 saw further gains over its cohorts in the Turing-based 20-series.

The key takeaways should be:

* ~37.5% is the average generation-over-generation performance uplift.
* Turing's performance uplift was about average. Marginally below average for the x70 and x80, but way above average for the x60. Turing's problem wasn't the performance uplift, it was the huge price hike, which invalidated the performance uplift for many.
* Pascal (10-series) saw the greatest generation-over-generation performance uplift. Users saying that this was ""normal"" are beholden to recency bias.
* As expected, the 500-series and 700-series (Fermi ""2"" and Kepler ""2"") were the worst performance gains. As I stated earlier, you're not wrong if you feel that I should have treated these like the 20-Super series. But Nvidia marketed them as whole new products so they were treated as such.

#How it stacked up - x60

Here I'll examine how each x60 product stacked up against the prior generation lineup. I'll do the same for the x70 and x80 below. Why do this? Nvidia claimed that the 3070 has &gt; 2080 Ti performance. I want to see how often this happens. In each segment, I'll attempt to project the Ampere variant's real-world performance uplift. This is solely for fun and should not be taken as gospel. Because this is time-consuming, I'm not going back to Fermi. Instead, I'm going to start with Maxwell. This allows me to compare to prior x80 Ti products since the 780 Ti was the return of this suffix.

Also, math is funny. To be consistent, I wanted to use the card in the left column as the base. So while the GTX 960 is 29.08% slower than the GTX 780, using the 780 as the base, the 780 is 41% faster than the 960. If this is confusing, here's an easier to follow example. Let's say that the GTX A is half the speed of the GTX B. That means that GTX A is 50% slower, or, GTX B is 100% faster.

GPU|Prior x60|Prior x70|Prior x80
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
GTX 960|+11.11%|-10.71%|-29.08%
GTX 1060|+104.08%|+17.65%|+1.01%
GTX 2060|+56.25%|+17.65%|-2.00%

The GTX 960 was not a good card, as I mentioned earlier. It was telling that prior X60s were advertised as mainstream AAA gaming cards, but the GTX 960's marketing campaign revolved around esports titles. The GTX 960 was a marginal upgrade over the GTX 760. It really wasn't worth buying for an x60 owner unless you were still on Fermi.
 
But the GTX 1060 changed that, roughly doubling the 960's performance. It beat out the prior generation GTX 970, while roughly matching the GTX 980. We saw more of the same from the RTX 2060. It was a worthy upgrade for GTX 1060 owners, beat out the GTX 1070, and roughly matched the GTX 1080. With DLSS, it actually comes out ahead in some modern titles.

Where should the RTX 3060 line up? The optimistic side of me expects RTX 2080 performance out of it. But the pessimistic side of me thinks that Nidia might want to revert some of the massive gains the x60 has had in recent generations. I could see it roughly matching the RTX 2070, keeping the 6GB VRAM of prior cards, and being offered at $349. This would allow room for a Ti or Super to come in with 8GB of RAM and RTX 2080-like performance once AMD plays their hand, while still retaining a spot for the 3070. Like the 900-series, I suspect this is going to be a generation where Nvidia tries to coax traditional x60 buyers into an x70.


#How it stacked up - x70

GPU|Prior x70|Prior x80|Prior x80 Ti
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:
GTX 970|+41.18%|+17.07|-4.95%
GTX 1070|+66.67%|+40.85%|+13.64%
GTX 2070|+33.33%|+12.36%|-6.54%

The GTX 970 was a great card and the 1070 was even better. As we can see here, the x70 trading blows with the prior x80 Ti has occurred every generation since the re-introduction of the x80 Ti. Therefore, we should not be shocked that Nvidia is claiming that the RTX 3070 is faster than the RTX 2080 Ti.

My projection isn't quite as rosy. From Nvidia's claims, it appears that their comparison includes a lot of RTX titles. Most games still don't support DLSS and/or ray-tracing. I think that the RTX improvements bring the average up, and rasterization brings it down. As such, I expect the 3070 to be slightly faster than the 2080 Ti in RTX-enabled titles, but slightly slower in non-RTX-enabled titles. Also, in that same chart Nvidia claimed that the 3080 was twice as fast as the 2080, but the preview that we saw from Digital Foundry showed more of a roughly ~80% improvement. So, be pessimistic until we get real reviews.

#How it stacked up - x80

GPU|Prior x80|Prior x80 Ti
:--|:-:|:-:
GTX 980|+31.58%|+7.53%
GTX 1080|+69.49%|+36.99%
GTX 2080|+31.58%|+8.70%

Seems a bit like a tick-tock cycle. Compared to the prior x80 Ti, we see slighter faster, much faster, slightly faster...so the next one would be ""much faster."" And that is what Nvidia has claimed, that the 3080 would be noticeably faster than the 2080 Ti, and double the performance of the 2080. As noted above, DF's preview showed the 3080 as being roughly 80% faster than the 2080 in games pre-selected by Nvidia. I think the worst case that we can expect is a card that improves over its predecessor much like the 1080 did. That's a pretty damn good worst case.

#Conclusion

This was a data-driven post so the conclusion depends on the questions that you had and the perspective you have coming into this. We can conclude that Turing was not a subpar performance uplift, just an ""average"" uplift paired with a price hike. Pascal was not a typical uplift, but instead, the best uplift Nvidia has had in at least a decade. And we can see that Ampere seeks to match or even beat that amazing uplift.

If you're an x80 buyer, the RTX 3080 looks to give the best generation-over-generation uplift we've seen in the segment, at least over the last decade. Worst case is that it ""only"" duplicates Pascal's uplift. This is going to be a great card.

If you're an x70 buyer, you should expect more of what you're used to - performance within spitting distance of last generation's x80 Ti. Best case is that it's a littler faster, and worst case is that it's a little slower. There is no bad news here, unless you recently bought a 2080 Ti.

But if you're an x60 buyer, there's some uncertainty. Nvidia has good reasons to release a 2080 competitor (if AMD has something competitive in the next few months), and good reasons to launch a cheaper dud with 6GB of VRAM (to leave plenty of space for a Ti/Super, and to encourage x60 owners to move to a 3070). There's a lot of latitude here and I'm curious to see which direction Nvidia ultimately goes with this card.

Amd,"Intel recently patched the workaround people were using to avoid the crippled AMD functions. 

I did some quick benchmarking to [prove the workaround no longer works](https://imgur.com/a/BXbEwtm). 

Generally, I see a straight up loss of 15-20% performance, due to Intel intentionally crippling software on AMD CPUs. (Other people have claimed much higher losses in other workloads.)

I want to know if AMD is ever going to comment on this issue? This is extremely serious for people doing scientific and computational work on AMD.

Amd,"Hello, I thought I'd just share my recent experience of filling up my DIMM slots on Zen 2, but before going into that, I'll list my specs:

* R7 3800X 
* G.Skill Flare X (3200 MHz CL 14)
* Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master
* RTX 2080
* 1TB 970 EVO
* 1TB 860 EVO
* H115i Corsair
* Creative Zx Soundcard
* Seasonic Platinum 760 Watt PSU

Now, to start off with my RAM specifications, I managed to overclock all four DIMMs to 3800 MHz CL 16 with a DRAM Voltage of 1.45V and SOC of 1.1V. I did test for errors and came out safe on that front, so my setup is stable. As a side note for comparison, when dialing in my overclocking on my RAM, I ended up with the same profile with four DIMMs as I was running with two DIMMs. 

Now, this post isn't here to show off benchmarks or attempt to break any records, but rather I had a surprising relative performance uplift from filling out my DIMMs and gaining extra capacity. My FPS is all relatively the same across the board, which is honestly to be expected, but the biggest indication of difference to me is how much smoother everything is now.

For perspective, I often run multiple instances of just *things* at the same time. So, for example, emulators. I would sometimes have one running in the background while also either playing another game or doing some work-related tasks that deal mainly with compiling. Even without simultaneously running other programs though, the performance in the emulator itself is a lot smoother, which was a surprise to me. I no longer get small hitches when going between menus in whatever game is on the emulator, or get slight stutters in some animations. 

However, this isn't just an uplift for the emulators that I use, but just about any other program I use. Post-loading times are much faster now, and overall frame times appear to be a lot more stable - even in really old games like Company of Heroes 1 that I have running in DX9. As an example of loading times, I am currently building a mod for Company of Heroes 2, and the modding kit included with the game usually took some time to load into when opening an attribute file. Since this RAM change, my re-loading times have been cut down by upwards of around 20 seconds, which is just astonishing to me.

Now, to leave off, one thing I'm not sure about is if this performance uplift is because of filling out DIMMs as a relative operative thing special to Zen 2, or if just simply increasing the capacity allowed for the uplift. I've always heard the notion that 16GB was more than enough for a good experience, and while I guess that may be true, my system, while pretty smooth overall, wasn't exactly performing as flawlessly as I thought it should be - and this is in despite of me constantly looking for issues that might be fixable but coming up with nothing out of the ordinary. With 16GB, my in-use and cached capacity never got to critical levels of where I'd run out of capacity, so I didn't think adding more RAM would do much, but now that I'm on 32GB, while my in-use is pretty much the same, the cached memory easily exceeds the 16GB capacity threshold.",My experience with moving from 2x8GB (16GB) to 4x8GB (32GB) on a 3800X.,hello thought share recent experi fill dimm slot zen go list spec r x g skill flare x mhz cl gigabyt x aoru master rtx tb evo tb evo h corsair creativ zx soundcard season platinum watt psu start ram specif manag overclock four dimm mhz cl dram voltag v soc v test error came safe front setup stabl side note comparison dial overclock ram end profil four dimm run two dimm post show benchmark attempt break record rather surpris rel perform uplift fill dimm gain extra capac fp rel across board honestli expect biggest indic differ much smoother everyth perspect often run multipl instanc thing time exampl emul would sometim one run background also either play anoth game work relat task deal mainli compil even without simultan run program though perform emul lot smoother surpris longer get small hitch go menu whatev game emul get slight stutter anim howev uplift emul use program use post load time much faster overal frame time appear lot stabl even realli old game like compani hero run dx exampl load time current build mod compani hero mod kit includ game usual took time load open attribut file sinc ram chang load time cut upward around second astonish leav one thing sure perform uplift fill dimm rel oper thing special zen simpli increas capac allow uplift alway heard notion gb enough good experi guess may true system pretti smooth overal exactli perform flawlessli thought despit constantli look issu might fixabl come noth ordinari gb use cach capac never got critic level run capac think ad ram would much gb use pretti much cach memori easili exce gb capac threshold experi move x gb gb x gb gb x
Amd,"Seriously, Force Anisotropic filtering dx9 only, in 2020? Why bother putting it there then? Sure, a browser is must have than a basic feature.

Amd,"I  recently upgraded from a i5 9400f/z370 to a r5 3600x/b550 it's really  just a side upgrade nothing major. The reason for upgrading was I needed  the extra 6 threads since my i5 was hitting 90-100% usage in my games  and was unable to properly record many games. Also AMD announced that  b450,x470,b550 and x570 motherboards will support the next generation of  ryzen zen 3 processors to give me an upgrade path.

I  have had more experience with intel in the past had an i7 920 build, i5  4570, i5 9400f,i7 6700, pentium g4560, pentium g5400, and i7 4770 where  as for amd I've only had a fx 8350 build, ryzen 2700 till I bent the  pins in a butterfingers situation while changing thermal paste and the  now 3600x cpu. So I've had my foot in both ball parks and here to give  an honest review of my new favorite cpu besides the i7 920 due to  nostalgia ;). Upon delivery of the 3600x I also received a Asrock b550m  steel legend board as well that I purchased from newegg. Installation  was fairly easy but when dealing with amd cpu's you can easily make a  mistake and bend a pin so be careful . I decided to use the wraith  cooler included as amd has been known to have much better in box coolers  than intel.

When I loaded in and  got my bios dealt with I tried enabling my ram X.M.P I originally  planned on reusing my rip.jaws ddr4 3600 cl18 ram with this build but  could not get it stable without manually oc'ing the ram to 2933mhz which  worked fine. I decided to say F it since I wasn't happy with the 2933  speed and installed a spare kit 16gbs of vengeance lpx 3200mhz cl16 into  the system then it worked fine at 3200mhz. I later saw that the  rip.jaws ram specifically said intel x.m.p 3600mhz so watch out with  your ram you choose as some brands use intel 2.0 xmp profiles which  don't work well with ryzen. After getting all that out of the way lets  get to the reason you came here how does it perform, how cool does it  run, and how much if any is it better than your previous 9400f.

To  start things off the 3600x scored a 130 single core score on  user-benchmark -(not a great source I know but the single core and multi  core benches are accurate)-while my i5 9400f can only manage 118 at  best so based upon that factor we should see technically a boost in  games that don't use more than 2-4 cores. The idel temps were 4-6  degrees higher than the 9400f and 10-11 degrees hotter while gaming but then again I used my old hyper 212 evo with the i5 as it was all i had on hand. Now to the juicy  bit the benchmarks in games.

I  tested a few games I felt were both gpu and cpu bound to give a fair  test. I benched gtav, csgo, far cry 5, Forza horizon 4, watch dogs 2,  left 4 dead 2, arma and vr titles like pavlov, blade and sorcery and  walking dead saints and sinners as I didn't want to test my entire steam  library as that would take to long as I own 182 games now with 14 being  free.

1. In  gtav at 1080p ultra with advanced settings off with a 2070 the avg for  the 3600x was 134 fps while the 9400f was 126 for the 1% lows the 3600x  saw 78fps and the i5 9400f saw 29fps.
2. For  csgo at competitive settings at 1080p the 3600x saw 255fps avg and the  9400f saw 173 fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 96 fps while the  9400f got 57 fps.
3. for  far cry 5 at 1080p high settings the 3600x saw an avg fps of 118 fps  while the 9400f saw 110 fps. for 1% lows the 3600x scored 45 fps while  the i5 9400f score 9 fps.
4. For  forza at 1080p ultra the 3600x saw 91 fps avg while the i5 9400f saw 87  fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 59 fps and the 9400f saw 23fps.
5. For  watch dogs 2 at medium 1080p the 3600x saw 88 fps avg and the 9400f saw  74fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 28fps and the 9400f scored 6  fps.
6. For  left 4 dead 2 at ultra 1080p the 3600x scored 289fps avg and the i5  9400f scored 216 fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 189 fps while the  9400f saw 56fps.
7. Arma  3 at medium settings at 1080p saw 104fps avg for the 3600x and 66 fps  avg for the i5. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 42fps while the i5 saw 39.
8. Now  it's time for vr. My particular headset has a 90hz refresh rate so we  are vr headset limited. In pavlov at ultra the 3600x saw 90fps locked at  avg while the 9400f stayed a consistent 82-83. For 1% lows the 3600x  saw 90fps and the 9400f saw 26fps.
9. For  blade and sorcery the 3600x was locked at 90fps for the avg and so was  the 9400f. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 79fps and the 9400f scored  37fps.
10. For  saints and sinners the 3600x saw 90fps locked for avg and the 9400f saw  87 avg. For 1% lows the 9400f scored 54 fps while the 3600x scored  75fps.
11. So  in conclusion the 3600x is a better cpu for gaming in general. The 3600x while not scoring a enormous lead on avg's the 1% lows where much better and experienced a more steady experience with more consistent frame timings making a more immersive experience. If you were to buy this cpu I recommend it only when it's on sale because it's usually 40-50 dollars more expensive than the 3600 for just 2-4 fps in games due to the 3600(x) coming stock  overclocked to +200mhz.",Honest review of r5 3600x for anyone considering buying.,recent upgrad f z r x b realli side upgrad noth major reason upgrad need extra thread sinc hit usag game unabl properli record mani game also announc b x b x motherboard support next gener ryzen zen processor give upgrad path experi intel past build f pentium g pentium g fx build ryzen till bent pin butterfing situat chang thermal past x foot ball park give honest review new favorit besid due nostalgia upon deliveri x also receiv asrock b steel legend board well purchas newegg instal fairli easi deal easili make mistak bend pin care decid use wraith cooler includ known much better box cooler intel load got bio dealt tri enabl ram x p origin plan reus rip jaw ddr cl ram build could get stabl without manual oc ing ram mhz work fine decid say f sinc happi speed instal spare kit gb vengeanc lpx mhz cl system work fine mhz later saw rip jaw ram specif said intel x p mhz watch ram choos brand use intel xmp profil work well ryzen get way let get reason came perform cool run much better previou f start thing x score singl core score user benchmark great sourc know singl core multi core bench accur f manag best base upon factor see technic boost game use core idel temp degre higher f degre hotter game use old hyper evo hand juici bit benchmark game test game felt bound give fair test bench gtav csgo far cri forza horizon watch dog left dead arma vr titl like pavlov blade sorceri walk dead saint sinner want test entir steam librari would take long game free gtav p ultra advanc set avg x fp f low x saw fp f saw fp csgo competit set p x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x score fp f got fp far cri p high set x saw avg fp fp f saw fp low x score fp f score fp forza p ultra x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x saw fp f saw fp watch dog medium p x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x score fp f score fp left dead ultra p x score fp avg f score fp avg low x saw fp f saw fp arma medium set p saw fp avg x fp avg low x saw fp saw time vr particular headset hz refresh rate vr headset limit pavlov ultra x saw fp lock avg f stay consist low x saw fp f saw fp blade sorceri x lock fp avg f low x score fp f score fp saint sinner x saw fp lock avg f saw avg low f score fp x score fp conclus x better game gener x score enorm lead avg low much better experienc steadi experi consist frame time make immers experi buy recommend sale usual dollar expens fp game due x come stock overclock mhz honest review r x anyon consid buy
Amd,"So I've noticed that I've been getting stuttering from my AMD pc's for close to two years since I first built a pc with a Ryzen 2600x, and just this past week bought a laptop that has a Ryzen 4800H and was still having the same issue (both Nvidia GPUs, 144hz monitors, G-sync capable).  I could never figure out what the issue was as I had tried nearly everything that you would find in forums searching google for answers.  I recently came across a post (that I conveniently now cannot locate) that mentions how having a speaker that only requires a 2.0 usb outlet being connected to a 3.0 outlet was giving a user stuttering issues.  In his case, it was a usb speaker.  In my case, it was a PS4 controller - PS4 controllers have a little speaker on them, so it was either this or the aux port on the bottom side of the controller itself that it's having a difficult time communicating with.  Low and behold, I tried playing with an Xbox One controller today (unplugging the DS4) and graphics were [smooth.as.silk](https://smooth.as.silk)!  No more terrible microstutters or choppiness anywhere!  I'm sure there's a way to disable the audio port on the PS4 controller and be able to use it that way, but I haven't played around with that yet.  I really got lucky with this because I definitely wouldn't have figured this out myself in a million years.

I'm not sure why it's not the non-X version, but otherwise I think this makes a lot of sense. Most tech journalists don't do this, they always seem to find ways to recommend Intel for more expensive builds, as they are (somewhat understandably) afraid of offending Intel fanboys.

I got a SKU with a 4500U, 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD. The machine feels and looks great, not super premium but definitely above its price. Display looks beautiful even though it's matte but the lower bezel could be smaller.

**Display**

As noted this is a matte display so reflections are almost non-existent. However, the 300 nit brightness leaves a lot to be desired in anything less than 90% brightness, the single biggest flaw on the machine. Colors look great though and viewing angles are what you'd expect from an IPS at this price.

**Performance**

The 4500U is a powerhouse for the TDP at 25W even without SMT. It's way too snappy for most of the things I do as a law student such as web browsing, doc writing and media consumption. However, when I want to use that 4 GHz boost it's reliable and seamless. For anyone interested, it scored a 2387 in Cinebench R20, an impressive score for a slim 25W ultrabook. Memory is fast but I really do not recommend 8 GB anymore as Windows takes a heavy chunk of that even when disabling non-critical processes.

As for the integrated graphics, I tried two titles which aren't the most demanding out there. Medieval Total War 2 got me a solid 60+ FPS at highest settings but I locked it (insert The Verge reference here) to keep temps lower. Also tried GTA V on High/medium and got about 45 FPS which was definitely playable but not that nice to watch. Now as far as temps are concerned, it's a mixed bag. The CPU package skyrockets to 101 degrees when gaming without fps limiters on and during more demanding titles. Fans kick in a bit too late but afterward they can keep the package at about 80 degrees and lower long term which I find acceptable for such a slim machine.

**Keyboard and touchpad**

Now coming from a 15,6 Acer thiccboi I was used to a hefty amount of real estate. Keys feel good to click but are shallow as you would expect. It does feel kind of cramped for an average sized male but you get used to it. Some key placements are quite annoying but this is also a Scandinavian keyboard which adds three letters. Caps lock button is way too big and up-and-down keys are way too small, love the FN keys for their utility though. Keyboard backlight has 3 levels but the lit options look the same and it does get bright.

Touchpad has an acceptable size for the form factor and feels smooth and every gesture works as you'd want, not much to add here.

**Battery Life**

The battery life has impressed me. The 61 Wh cell is decently sized and I've got about 10 hours of active use. This is mostly with full brightness and keyboard lighting off but with the power slider at the second option and Lenovo's Intelligent cooling. My rationale is that the CPU is fast enough to be run at low wattage and clocks, especially for most of my use cases.

**Other aspects**

Sound is great with the two front-firing speakers, a joy while streaming music or videos. The Windows Hello IR is good but not as reliable as a fingerprint reader and the web camera itself is average. Temps and fans during light usage are great pros of the device, temps are low at about 45 degrees and fans are completely quiet. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are extremely solid with the Wi-Fi 6 Intel chip, no issues encountered whatsoever.

**Conclusion**

I love this machine and its value proposition which is a lot better compared to the usual Macbook Air students like to pick up here in Sweden (dual core in 2020, come on). Build, performance and battery life are the biggest pros while the biggest con is by far the low display brightness. Lenovo doesn't really seem to be offering a 400-nit option and it is usually non-configurable at their website which means it's the best AMD got this time around. The memory works fine but capacity was lackluster, something which is of course due to the SKU.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who doesn't really need discrete graphics and the fastest and most powerful CPU even though you can get your hands on an 8-core 4800U SKU if you're lucky.",Short-term review of the Yoga Slim 7,got sku u gb ram gb ssd machin feel look great super premium definit price display look beauti even though matt lower bezel could smaller display note matt display reflect almost non exist howev nit bright leav lot desir anyth less bright singl biggest flaw machin color look great though view angl expect ip price perform u powerhous tdp w even without smt way snappi thing law student web brows doc write media consumpt howev want use ghz boost reliabl seamless anyon interest score cinebench r impress score slim w ultrabook memori fast realli recommend gb anymor window take heavi chunk even disabl non critic process integr graphic tri two titl demand mediev total war got solid fp highest set lock insert verg refer keep temp lower also tri gta v high medium got fp definit playabl nice watch far temp concern mix bag packag skyrocket degre game without fp limit demand titl fan kick bit late afterward keep packag degre lower long term find accept slim machin keyboard touchpad come acer thiccboi use hefti amount real estat key feel good click shallow would expect feel kind cramp averag size male get use key placement quit annoy also scandinavian keyboard add three letter cap lock button way big key way small love fn key util though keyboard backlight level lit option look get bright touchpad accept size form factor feel smooth everi gestur work want much add batteri life batteri life impress wh cell decent size got hour activ use mostli full bright keyboard light power slider second option lenovo intellig cool rational fast enough run low wattag clock especi use case aspect sound great two front fire speaker joy stream music video window hello ir good reliabl fingerprint reader web camera averag temp fan light usag great pro devic temp low degre fan complet quiet wi fi bluetooth extrem solid wi fi intel chip issu encount whatsoev conclus love machin valu proposit lot better compar usual macbook air student like pick sweden dual core come build perform batteri life biggest pro biggest con far low display bright lenovo realli seem offer nit option usual non configur websit mean best got time around memori work fine capac lacklust someth cours due sku wholeheartedli recommend anyon realli need discret graphic fastest power even though get hand core u sku lucki short term review yoga slim

Amd,"I've been using this machine for a couple weeks now and I can definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a compact powerhouse of a laptop.  I use it as my primary laptop for daily use, school, and some periodic gaming and it seems as if nothing can slow this laptop down.  My model is equipped with the Ryzen 9 4900HS, RTX 2060 MaxQ, 16gb, and 1TB NVMe.  The 4900HS is the center of attention in this laptop, and for a good reason.  Despite being one of the most powerful mobile CPUs on the market, it is surprisingly subtle in day to day use.  By that I mean it stays very cool and draws very little power (significantly less than its competitors under full load too).  That contributes to this laptops amazing 8 to 10 hours of battery life.  That battery life in a gaming laptop of this caliber is impressive to say the least.  The SSD is noticeably snappy and the 120hz display makes everything more fluid and enjoyable.  RTX graphics makes this laptop capable of playing any title and utilizing the latest graphics technology.  If you're in the market for a laptop for editing on the go, or RTX Minecraft between your CS classes, this is a strong option if you're wiling to fork out the money.  I got mine for $1,349.99 and compared to other laptops around this price point, the hardware value is hard to match if you're looking for raw performance.  Is has battery life over gaming laptops, and processing power over premium options like the MBP and Dell XPS lineup.  I definitely recommend this laptop.

The XT release didn't help either. I wanted to just stop there and get an XT processor if reviews were positive but we all know how that turned out. That was a tough time. I was like ""AMD focus on Zen 3 please"".

Amd,"Hi all, I am new to overclocking/tweaking so I am learning at I go. My base setup:

CPU: 3900x

GPU: 1080ti sc black

MOBO: C8H

RAM: 32 GB 3600 cl17-18-18-18

Cooling: open loop with 3 240 rads, both CPU and GPU are on the same loop

PSU: thermaltake toughpower grand rgb 850

Tweaks:

RAM AND IF: I tweaked the RAM UP to 3733 and have it at 1.39V (it might go lower voltage wise but this seemed to boot well so I can play with it more later). I then set the fclk to 1867 to couple it with the RAM speed

CPU: I turned PBO on with a 5x scalar, set 200mHz offset

Characteristics of tweaks: It gamed while streaming 1080p 60 fps for a few hours the other night with no hitches. Right now cinebench score is about 7230 or so with chrome open and lot of apps like discord running in the background (not great but not terrible, I will figure out how to shut down all background apps for a more reliable score soon). It passes intel burn test on High, but only hit 9 outputs on very high and 2 on maximum. My peak single core clock seems just shy of 4.4 GHz, I have never seen a single core reach 4.6. I am currently running prime95 large fft to test that the memory overclock is stable.

Main questions:

How to get better single core clocks? Not that the CPU is performing particularly bad per se but it would be nice to actually see 4.6 at some point.

Intel Burn test does not crash and temps never exceeds 75 deg (Ryzen master) but it still says system not stable at max and very high. I don't think it is cooling. Would fclk cause this? Anything I can do to improve stability?

Is there a direct test to ensure fclk is stable?

Amd,"A lot of people are under the assumption that the reason why RTG is so quiet is because they've got something that can actually give Nvidia a run for their money. But they want Nvidia to show their hand first. This is wrong because if they've got something good they should have been screaming from the rooftops not to buy ampere. They knew Ryzen 1000 was going to shake up the market and we had shit ton of ""controlled leaks"". Ryzen 3000 was basically the same, Zen 2 was pretty much going to dethrone Intel and they were quite vocal about that too. But I'm not seeing that behavior in regards to their next gen gpus.   
  
  
So on the other hand some folks are saying they don't have anything that can compete with the likes of the RTX 3080 or 3090. And instead of over hyping a disappointing product, they'll release it without much fuss and call it a day. As they've learned from their past experiences like with Vega. (poor volta anyone?)  
  
If you think about it, almost all the information we've gotten regarding RDNA2 has come from Microsoft and Sony for their upcoming consoles. The Xbox series X and playstation 5. Apart from some info we heard in some conferences quarterly calls, not much information was given to us directly.  
  
The main reason being amd don't care about desktop graphics. This is really just a small side gig for them when they have other major markets that will bring them in a lot More revenue. Right now they're dominating the diy space with Ryzen 3000, and they'll literally delete Intel once Zen 3 comes out. Manufacturers transition happens slowly in the datacenter space, but we know that Rome absolutely crushes intel Xeon, and Milan is going to spread them blue cheeks absolutely nail them so hard where they never thought possible.  
  
RTG is going to make crap ton of money from the consoles. They've also got more laptops moving with the Ryzen 4000 mobile cpus. They just don't care about desktop graphics because they know Nvidia is going to beat them. And instead of properly trying to compete with them, they've actually joined them in this cozy hot tub of inflated gpu prices. Just look at the 5700XT series. These were supposed to be the direct replacement for the RX 480 and 470. But instead of delivering them at that 200-250 sweet spot category, they're like nah let's over price our gpus like Nvidia did. Because who cares about desktop graphics.  
   
So with big navi, regardless of even if they have good products to compete. It doesn't matter because they're just going to join Nvidia in whatever pricing scheme that they're going to use to take advantage of the consumers with. Once they know Nvidia's prices, they'll be like ""alright here's a similar perfoming card for $50 cheaper, maybe buy us, maybe dont? We don't care because we're focused on other shit."" 
 
So if you were wondering why AMD has been so quiet, there's your answer. Its because it's one of the last thing that's on their minds. If RTG was actually serious we would have definitely seen something by now. Something to deter or distract the userbase or prospective buyers from their marketing campaign. But nope, they just quietly sat by and counted down with Nvidia. 
 
Come release time for big navi, they'll release it. It won't be all that special, pricing will be barely better than nvidia, but who cares. Their die hard fans will buy them, and they'll continue to focus on the other markets that's more important to them.","AMD's silence is being misunderstood.

Amd,"I am trying to choose a motherboard for a new system, and I wanted an x570 to get support for the new AMD chips coming out this year. I like black and red, but would except a black one as well. Looking around it seems like my only options were MSI MPG gaming plus and Gigabyte gaming x (for under $200), my only problem is I wanted to overclock, and these don't have the best of VRM temps.

Amd,"Hi,

I just finished my first custom loop and wanted to share my findings on how to lower the temperature on the infamous HotSpot.

A little background: I build my system almost 2 years ago (autumn 2018) with a Vega 64 Sapphire Nitro+. I do occasional gaming on a 2k monitor 144hz with FreeSync with no problems, as I don't play very demanding games. But last Xmas I noticed that more and more often the fans began to ramp up for a longer time, sounding like a plane taking off. Did a little research and learned about what was the HotSpot, and using HWInfo I saw it hitting between 92ºC and 98ºC.

I started to seek how to reduce both, temps and sound, and found myself headlong towards a custom watercooled loop.

Well, loop is complete and here are the results of the HWInfo before and after a FireStrike Stress Test (default settings on WattMan Global):

[Before Test \(after gaming 30'\)](https://preview.redd.it/wiqtx6exd5k51.jpg?width=683&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8714c2efa2340b29dbcc8bb5b3b158995b6430a)

&amp;#x200B;

[After Test \(Sensors reseted before begin\)](https://preview.redd.it/5yntgnsyd5k51.jpg?width=684&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a35a2fb0999d1646d4bd663dc3a1b95accfcd5ab)

As you can see, the results speak for themselves: almost halved the temp.

The secret it's here: [Igor's Lab - Vega and the ominoese HotSpot](https://www.igorslab.de/en/amd-radeon-rx-vega-of-ominoese-hotspot-and-the-right-application-of-waermeleitpaste/). Followed both procedures, TIM application and bolting order/tightening.

For those curious about it: Original paste was dry and cracked, so even applying new paste would have lowered the temps. If you don't want to go down the rabbit hole of watercooling it's worth a try.

List of materials used:GPU: Radeon RX Vega 64 Sapphire Nitro+ (Unmolded die).

WC Block: Alphacool RX Vega M05 with backplate.

TIM: Grizzly Kryonaut 1 gram. Used almost all.

Thermal Pads: I refuse to use the thermal pads provided with the gpu block and used Gelid GP-Extreme instead.

Amd,"Hi Guys, I'm posting this as sorta Review of AMD's RMA Service, but also as a Discussion too! 

Since I bought my 3900X Back in Sept. 2019, I've had this boot up error '8d"". would happen about 80% of the time on a cold boot after the system had been off for more than say 6-8 Hours! Now, other than this Error, The system has been running Great! 

Now as for things I've tried to fix the Issue I can say I've tried Every suggest I could find on here and other Tech forum site to no avail! This ""8d"" isn't even listed in either of my Motherboard Manuals.  I've tweaked Bios Setting for the Ram, V core and SOC. I've literally switched out Ram and GPU's and Even tried a Different Motherboard. I've also, since Sept. of last year, updated the Bios like 4-5 times hoping one of those would fix it.... Nope,still gets stuck on 8d. 

I've seen others post about the Issue and it's almost always a Ryzen 3000 series CPU. Since the only thing I haven't switched out is the CPU, so I went a Bought a 3800X and it's been about 2 Months, and NO 8d error!!

So I decided to Contact AMD support a Month ago and Request an RMA on my CPU for what I believe is a Bad Memory Controller. (Assuming this based on ""Ram"" debug LED is on when Boots to 8d)

After a Few back a forth email from them making sure I tried... Bla, Bla, Bla! You know how Customer Service is! LOL!  I was authorized to return the CPU for Verification testing. 2 weeks ago, I received Email confirmation that the CPU was defective (no Details on exactly what was the defect) and they were sending me out a Replacement! I was like, O-k-a-y...  

So, I guess what I'm asking is, Did AMD just confirm that the ""8d' Post code is a Memory Controller issue??  

Has anyone else with this Issue tried to RMA their CPU?

Also should note that the replacement CPU was a Brand New, still sealed in the Retail Box, 3900X!! I thought for sure that even if they replaced My old 3900X, it would be a tray CPU only in the plastic holder. Bit of a Shocker, but Happy to see AMD honoring there Warranties to the Max!

Amd,"So in the lights of the coming GPU generation from AMD and Nvidia, here are my thoughts.

I was glad that AMD changed their minds so that the Zen 3 CPUs will be supported by X470. So I could get a new Zen 3 CPU later this year and still use my X470 (Asus Crosshair VII Hero with a monoblock) board. But It just hit me that the new GPUs from both AMD and Nvidia will use PCIe 4.0. But AMD decided months ago that X470 will not get an AGESA Update for PCIe 4.0 support. 

So If not for the coming Zen 3 CPUs, now I have to buy a new Mainboard for the coming high-end GPUs so I won't get a performance hit. Kinda sucks If you ask me. Especially If you know that your current X470 Board could support PCIe 4.0.",X470 and the coming GPU Generation,light come gener thought glad chang mind zen cpu support x could get new zen later year still use x asu crosshair vii hero monoblock board hit new gpu use pcie decid month ago x get agesa updat pcie support come zen cpu buy new mainboard come high end gpu get perform hit kinda suck ask especi know current x board could support pcie x come gener

Amd,"A common theme right now is to upgrade now or upgrade later.  It's not a simple question to answer but can be somewhat simplified by focusing on value ($ per performance) rather than raw performance.

To help visualize this, I created the spreadsheet below incorporating data from the following:

* Wikichip - launch dates and prices
* Current price - Newegg
* CPU Monkey - R20 single and multi-scores

***TLDR***: Ryzen chips tend to shrink in price until they hit 5 cents per R20 CB.  At that point, they tend to hover.  Finding a chip around the 5-6 cents per R20 CB will provide you **a sweet spot of value and performance**.  Select a chip based on your use case of gaming only, production only, or a hybrid.

***ELI5***: find the best chip **you can afford** where the $/R20 CB is near 5 cents.

Want to see a bit more?  Continue…

I focused on the R5 and R7 chips from 1st through 3rd generation Ryzen as a basis of comparison.  You can add the 3rd generation's R9 offerings if your budget allows.  The $/R20 CB is based on the (price) / (R20 Multi) score to determine the cost per CB.  Note, the CPU Monkey tables are based on practical figures and not what can be achieved through overclocking.  Naturally, if you get a better boost from your chip, the $/R20 figure will go down resulting in a better value.  For the 2700, I selected the 2700X since current pricing on the X variant is significantly cheaper than the standard non-X variant.

I also added a Zen 3 placeholder with an assumption of 15% IPC uplift for single and multicore.  Will it be more? less? it's **not** that important when examining the cost to obtain a single R20 CB point.  We are talking about a range of 5 cents per CB at launch prices.

[Figures to compare R5 and R7 with respect to Cinebench R20](https://preview.redd.it/zq16vemz2zj51.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f671dd3882bb9b813cbb43865e092f7154dadf7)

What does the table reveal?  In R20 Multi, the performance uplift per generation is definitely faster.  For the jump from the 2700X and 3700X, we have a 20%+ increase in multicore performance at a current cost of about 30% more.  20% more performance for 30% more money.  Does this mean that there is no reason to get the 3700X?  No.  If we look at the $/R20, at 6 cents per CB, both chips provide the same overall value based ***on current pricing***.  If you want better performance, you pay more money for the 3700X but are not paying a premium for that additional performance.  Compare the 3700X to the 3600 - you're paying an additional 1 cent per CB (the premium) - not bad.  The only time you're getting less value for the chip is at launch (duh) but the price will trend to roughly 5-6 cents per CB - even when the chip is two generations older.

To answer the question, should I wait?

At launch, the 3700X was 7 cents per CB.  The cheapest a new 3700X has ever been priced on Newegg and Amazon is $260 - translating to 5 cents per CB which corresponds to the averages that parts that have been on the market for a while achieve.  If the theory is that Zen 3 will result in chips dipping into the 3 cents per CB area, that theory is probably not going to pan out for 2nd and 3rd generation chips based on the data presented.  If you're waiting to get a 2nd or 3rd generation at a significant discount at the introduction of Zen 3, you're probably going to be disappointed.  Can you save 1 cent per CB? Maybe? Probably.

Instead, selecting based on value versus raw performance is where you will get the best bang for buck (I mean, quite literally).  It's easy to get glazed over with the IPC uplift terminology, higher boost clocks, etc.  In the law of averages and general use of a computer you can say confidently ""more cores, more recent generation, more clock"" is faster.  How that ""faster"" applies to you is subjective and often driven on the amount of $ you have to spend.

AMD makes this easier for us with a far superior backward compatibility (AM4/chipset) than on Intel.  Paired with a modern motherboard, you can opt to purchase a more modern CPU in the future when its $/R20 reaches near 5 cents per CB and get an instant upgrade.  Acquiring a chip at 7+ cents per CB, you're likely paying a premium for the CPU potential provided.",Buy now… buy later?

Amd,"Hello, I am buying my first laptop. Im living in eastern Europe and here i can't really customize laptops as people in the US. Inside my price range I have two laptops that catch my eye - both Lenovo Legion 5.

First one has Ryzen 7 4800H with 16gb of ram and GeForce GTX 1650 with a downside - 120Hz panel with only 45% ntsc which should make colors washed up and not as good as they should be. As i am a computer design student colors are important to me and that might create a problem.

Second option is a 60 dollar cheaper Legion with Ryzen 5 4600H, 8 gb of ram (that i can upgrade with the 60 bucks left) and a GeForce 1650 Ti but with a 72% ntsc screen with 50 more bits and 144Hz refresh rate (refresh rate is not that important to me). 

My question is how much better is the Ryzen 7 4800H because in the end, processor is more important to me than the gpu. However, if the Ryzen 7 is not much better than the Ryzen 5 in this situation i could settle for the cheaper version because if i upgrade 8 to 16 ram, the only downside is having a (hopefully not that much) worse processor.

Amd,"Am I doing this right?

First time building a server-like computer and I have gotten excited about the 2nd Gen EPYC line! I read a number of posts ([e.g. this forum](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/threadripper-build-for-relion-cryo-em-protein-resolving/141100), [WarpEM hardware recommendations](http://www.warpem.com/warp/?page_id=65), along with builds offered by industry vendors) to get a sense of balance between investing in RAM, GPU, and CPU for a Cryo-EM application, though I have a lot to learn here. Most vendors opt for Xeon-builds, but they do not optimize for value-driven performance. Ultimately, I landed on an EPYC-based build with a pair of RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.

I had originally looked into the [Gen 3 Threadripper](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Rp44yk) but was leary of the lack of buffered-ECC RAM and general gaming-tilt. Ideally a workstation/server like this will scale-up for future Lab builds and the Threadripper-compatible motherboards don't tend to scale beyond 3-GPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

Outstanding questions:

1. Does it make sense to hold out for an ATX Supermicro H12 motherboard?
2. [EPYC 7402](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7402) selected based on number of cores &amp; [price/core](https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AMD-EPYC-7Fx2-Launch-SKUs-Value-Analysis-Cost-Per-Core.jpg) (although the higher clock speeds for the  [EPYC™ 7F72](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7f72) are appealing), is this a miserly choice?
3. [Cooling](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3604-best-gaming-pc-cases-for-airflow-in-2020-right-now)\- For home-use I love the Fractal Define series, but here I'm hedging on cooling needs and am looking at their Meshify case, or the bequiet Dark Base (need to verify volume accommodations). Is air-cooling sufficient, should the case be purposefully over-sized for better active/passive cooling?
4. I believe I can get an academic discount for an NVIDIA GPU (\~20%), such as the [Titan RTX](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-Titan-RTX-vs-Nvidia-RTX-2080-Ti/m664199vs4027) or [Quadro RTX 5/6k](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-vs-Nvidia-Quadro-RTX-5000/4026vsm712800) but the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti units come in at such a high-value it would be hard to pass up. (Perhaps this is why they're surprisingly difficult to source at the moment). Many industry builds cite higher-end cards like the [P100](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/Molecular-Dynamics-Oct-2017-MB-slides.pdf) but they are so far outside of my price range I get the impression consumer-end cards are the right direction.
5. I hope registered ECC RAM is worth the expense here, along with the 2133 vs. 3600 Mhz hit.
6. Any critical accessories (aside from a nice [32"" ISP monitor](https://www.asus.com/us/Monitors/ProArt-PA32UC/) and peripherals) to consider?

Minor vent:

I had some vendors preach about warranty and liability which rubbed me the wrong way; I would love to spend more on the components and less on mark-up, as this is on an academic grant but can appreciate the value of offloading IT headaches. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" A lot of those parts to include CPU and memory, only come with a 1 year manufacturer’s warranty. If these GPU systems aren’t designed and supported by a company with expertise, then you can run into heat issue which will fry your parts. In that case, as failures come up you are juggling individual warranty issues with different manufacturers, which I guarantee would not be a fun experience. If warranty is short, you risk the additional costs to bring in new parts and the down time from research computing associated with that. With a system from us, we warrant the entire system and as support issues come up we respond and replace parts quickly minimizing downtime.   
&gt;  
&gt;To me it is a no brainer and huge value, but what do I know. ;-)  ""

Amd,"Hi guys, 

I'm not really up to date on the latest updates regarding BIOS for AMD x370 boards.

Link for the bios page: https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/X370%20Taichi/#BIOS

I'm running a Ryzen 3700X with Taichi X370 board and I'm curious has anyone updated so far to this version and is it working out for people that did, also what improvements did it really bring?

I'm currently running 5.80 (1.0.0.3) version.

Also this might be slightly out of topic but ever since I've updated my BIOS something around 5.XX my Dr.Debug screen on the motherboard usually says ""AA"".

I looked around for a bit didn't find anything significant and I haven't really encountered any issues.

Any tips you guys might have would be appreciated.

Amd,"I am planning to build a midrange gaming PC in late 2020. In it, I am planning to put a **high end B450 motherboard instead of a mid range B550 or a low end X570**. And this is my line of thinking:

1. **CPU Socket WILL get outdated**: I will buy an AM4 Zen 2 CPU (Ryzen 5 3600 or 7 3700x) which should last me more than 3 years. By the time I plan to upgrade my CPU, the de facto socket will br AM5 or AM6 (Zen 4 or 5). Hence no matter what, B450, B550 and X570 will all be obsolete. Since I will not get a Zen 3 CPU to upgrade my Zen 2, B550 or X570 do not matter.
2. **PCIe 4.0 is not very affordable/essential**:The PCIe 4.0 support is not very crucial (pun intended) for an average gamer, right? Especially for another 2-3 years. NVMe and SATA SSDs are already very fast on a mid range system. And graphics card such as the RTX 2070/2080 Super run just as fine on the B450 motherboards. I don't think I require fancy sound or capture cards. So PCIe 4.0 does not look like a necessity/good to have even 2-3 years down the line.
3. **Prices are very competitive**: \~$200 B450 motherboards (eg. MSI B450 GAMING PRO CARBON MAX WIFI, TOMAHAWK) should have decent VRMs and cooling to overclock the Zen 2 CPUs. Plus you can get better aesthetics, wireless connectivity etc. for the price of a mid range B550 or low end X570. With the savings, you can invest in a more future proof CPU or GPU.

Hence, for an average gamer, I feel that a high end B450 motherboard is a smarter choice if you're building a PC (even a high end one) in late 2020, as any major upgrade will require a new motherboard in 2-3 years. Again, this is just my opinion, and things very prom person to person and requirement to requirement. **Please let me know if I don't understand or am missing something.**",Should you buy a B450 in late 2020?

Amd,"Prior to covid19, the last time i played with computers was 2005. I had a whole mess of 

AthlonXP rigs i used for video encoding, and they were still running strong as office computers when I retired to spend time with my kids in 2014.

Amd,"Hello guys!

Sorry for my bad english in advance as i didn't use it for quite some time.

I'm writing this post to get some help from you with choosing what I should do first. I know that there is still plenty of time before Zen 3 CPU's and new RTX GPU's will be released, but I need to make some plans so I can save money for new components.

So my PC rig excluding displays and some smaller components right now is:

\- CPU: Ryzen 5 1600 AE @ 3.85Ghz 1.3V (I didn't tweak it too much cause I don't have time right now)

\- GPU: Zotac GTX 1070 Mini

\- RAM: Crucial Ballistix BL2K8G32C16U4B @ 3200Mhz CL14

\- MOBO: MSI B350 Tomahawk Arctic

\- PSU: Corsair RM750i

I thought about getting new CPU (ZEN 3 and OC sh\*t out of it) for this GPU and change my mobo but I started to think about If it is worth. There would be probably \~20FPS boost in games and more stability but is it worth?

I mean this is probably the last ZEN gen for AM4, so isn't it better to wait for AM5 and get ZEN 2 cpu as cheap as possible (if it will be possible to use it on my mobo) waiting for it or don't change CPU at all and maybe buy new RTX 3070-3080 for example?

I know that my CPU will probably be bottlenecking new RTX's but all I need is 60FPS in new games (mostly RPG, Racing, RTS etc.) with settings at max and 144FPS in FPS games (cause I'm pretty competetive playing Overwatch, CS:GO and sometimes COD: Warzone).",The time for change has come...,hello guy sorri bad english advanc use quit time write post get help choos first know still plenti time zen new rtx releas need make plan save money new compon pc rig exclud display smaller compon right ryzen ae ghz v tweak much caus time right zotac gtx mini ram crucial ballistix bl k g c u b mhz cl mobo msi b tomahawk arctic psu corsair rm thought get new zen oc sh chang mobo start think worth would probabl fp boost game stabil worth mean probabl last zen gen better wait get zen cheap possibl possibl use mobo wait chang mayb buy new rtx exampl know probabl bottleneck new rtx need fp new game mostli rpg race rt etc set max fp fp game caus pretti competet play overwatch cs go sometim cod warzon time chang come

Amd,"August 28th is recognized as Software Freedom Day! It’s a day where organizations and individuals around the world raise awareness for, and celebrate the existence of, [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software). Whatever you may wish to call it - free software, free and open source software, libre software - we love it, and it deserves to be celebrated.

## What is “free software” or “free and open source software”?

Contrary to what the dictionary definition of “free” might imply, *free software* doesn’t refer to price. It refers to the *freedoms* you are given when you obtain free software. Users of free software are [protected under all four of the following freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition):

1. **The freedom to use the program as you wish.** This means nobody can tell control what limitations there are on where, how, when, or who can run the software. You are permitted any conceivable use of the software - even ones the original creators didn’t intend or consider.
2. **The freedom to study the source code and make changes.** This means you must be given access to the source code of the program and can study it for educational purposes, and even make changes or improvements to how the program works. Even as a nonprogrammer, this freedom benefits you because you can recruit, or even pay, programmers to make the modifications you desire.
3. **The freedom to redistribute and share the software.** This means that you have just as much of a right to distribute the program as the original author has. Organizations can install it on machines they sell, individuals can hand it out on USB drives... there’s no limitation.
4. **The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others.** This is the ultimate enhancement to the previous two freedoms. This freedom essentially solidifies your rights as equal even to the original creator and distributor of the program. The creator may own the website and the GitHub repository, but you can just as rightfully start and run your own “fork”.

## Wait, isn’t that communism or something!?

[Ha, ha. Very funny! But no](https://i.imgur.com/J258bAy.png)... Software released under a “free software license” is done so consensually by the contributors(s) of the project. It’s great that *one little person* has the power to attach such a strong set of permanent protections to something they create.

## Where did this all start?

The concept of “free software” began when [Dr. Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) released the first version of the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) in 1989. The idea, however, began long before. Richard Stallman simply sought a more legally binding way to ensure things could still be done as they were in the early days of personal computing, as the adolescent computing industry began to grow more corporatized.

## How does free software benefit me?

**You’re using it right now**. Much of the software platforms that drive the operation of the modern world is built on the foundation of free software. Web servers, web browsers, drivers, and even entire operating systems in popular products in use all over the world today are powered in part or entirely by free software. Let’s also not forget that creators of non-free (proprietary) software are often forced to compete with, and attempt to keep up with, free software. So, even if the software you’re using isn’t free, you can thank free software for many of the features and benefits it offers you.

## Why should I use and support free and open source software?

Because it’s one less thing to worry about. Remember Windows 8? When users don’t have any control over the software they use every day, **the proprietor can change, kill, or ruin it** **at any time**. There’s nothing anyone can do but complain, or just accept it. When you use *free and open source* software, you can be confident that it’s going to remain usable, *even* if the project heads in a direction you don’t like - someone somewhere will either add a “legacy mode”, run a “legacy fork”, or improve the new version to appeal better to users that liked the previous version.

Free and open source software also tends to be **highly compatible** and **well matured**. It’s been compiled for all sorts of different operating systems and platforms, and each of those versions are likely to be well-tested and up-to-date. Free software never dies; it only awaits improvements.

Amd,"I finally decided on my new Motherboard and CPU. I need help to pick the best ram for around 120€

CPU: R5 3600Mobo: X570 Tomahawk WIFI

RAM: I am still looking for the best deal

GPU: Pny RTX 2060 Super

I've been looking at the Qualified Vendors list for this, because i've experienced usb ports not working and other weirdness when i used ramsticks in my older builds(with ryzen 5 3600X and b550aorus pro), that were not on that list.

Ideally i want to get to that sweet 3800MhzCl16 that Ryzen 3000 seems to be maxing out at.

All the 3800Mhz DIMMS that are listed in that list come as sets of 8 or more DIMMS per buy.. I really only need 2x8gb sticks and i need them to work rock solid with xmp 2.0.

Also i saw a [video about  Dual Sided Ramsticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSJmN1fynsU&amp;t=330s). My conclusion was, that Ryzen 3000 benefits from it.So ideally i want it to be dual sided too( seems like min. 1% fps when gaming are higher with dual sided rams. Max fps dont change much)

QVL here: [https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/MAG-X570-TOMAHAWK-WIFI#support-mem-19](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/MAG-X570-TOMAHAWK-WIFI#support-mem-19)

I cant find any 3800Mhz Kit on that list that i can afford so I looked into the 3600MhzCl16 sticks. good enough for me anyways.

I found these on the list  [F4-3600C16Q-64GTZRC](https://imgur.com/a/UARGiWZ)

I could not find the  F4-3600C16Q-64GTZRC  in any of the shops i was looking but i found

F4-3600C16D-16GTZRC for around 100€

[F4-3600C16D-16GTZRC ](https://preview.redd.it/inneyuaoapj51.png?width=1656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d92b0e611f10b29b191a3fd7883b665a7ef011)

Will the F4-3600C16D-16GTZRC be as compatible with my cpu and mainboard as the 'LISTED'  F4-3600C16Q-64GTZRC ?

I dont want to take a gamble because dealing with RAM incompability is a pain in the ass....

If these dont work i think i'll go for a 3600Mhz Single sided kit then... however they are single sided, so that makes me lean away from them abit

[ F4-3600C16D-16GTZ](https://preview.redd.it/p6nlyjaubpj51.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8db14f5becb9777262f8b2db726bb13f06273395)

but the  [F4-3600C16D-16GTZ are on the QVL](https://imgur.com/a/1h1E1qT), so thats a PLUS!

I built the whole thing in a prebuilt 2003/2004 micro ATX case he had... Was afraid of thermals but with only 2 case fans it runs really cool at stock, maybe the case being metal helps

ANYWAY THE ISSUE...

I don't understand overclocking on Gigabyte boards. No matter what I put on dynamic vcore, be it -0,300 or +0,300 on hwinfo voltage stays the same... Same for soc voltage...

RAM overclocking works fine tho

I am suspecting hwinfo reading incorrectly because BIOS reported the change...

I tried +0,100, the BIOS reported around 1,30V for 4,0Ghz, hwinfo reported 1,14, crashed in 10 seconds in prime95...

My 2600 does 4 GHz @ 1,23/1,25V, so I think the hwinfo reading maybe correct? Or was the BIOS correct and maybe the chip is not the best overclocker? 

Why no fixed voltage on Gigabyte? In my MSI board I find OC way easier..

Tbh I ended up not messing around much 'cause I think my BIOS voltage settings were not applying at all... and he has GTX 760 for now waiting to upgrade so overclock not really needed now.

To finish, another person I know also has a gigabyte board and the same happens he ended up overclocking using Ryzen Master

Amd,"Adrenaline or older versions of Radeon Software **never have been bug-free**, always issues.

1. WHQL or non-WHQL versions failed, waking up my pc from sleep state its a matter of probability, checked, rechecked and reset-ed settings of power options, used different configurations, the same for adrenaline. All kind of configurations including clean installs of windows, in the past 2 years from the moment i bought my pc in 2018 until now  i have never been able to fix my PC sleep state that doesn't wakes up
2. GPU fans impossible to configure correctly. Tuning ON or OFF tuning of GPU Fans sometimes loses configuration, sometimes keeps it. When using advanced control of GPU Fan i can onyl set a fixed RPM speed, never had that option that i see on some sites or youtube videos about a **FAN Curve** option on the Advanced control panel when speed changes automatically according to a configured curve, not even on the old radeon software in 2018-2019. My fixed RPM number is always 900 higher than actual reported RPM speed. I set it to 2400 and get 1500 reported speed :/ . I checked with HWMonitor same thing. GPU tuning never saves, it always resets when closed.
3. Per-game configuration of display are saved correctly but since it applies automatically on game launch, it never turns off only on the game Valorant. My occasion is: i use color enhancements on display configuration when playing and then disable after finished playing a game. This is never done automatically both ways.

Today is 28 august 2020 and now i have v20.8.1, oh wait a new version is up (20.8.3), wait no fixes reported on release notes. I do not hope AMD support to get better in the future.

Amd," As of now, NVIDIA dominates the majority of dedicated GPU mobile space with only few exceptions equipped with Radeon RDNA1 video cards. By the end of the year AMD will announce RDNA2 definitely only for the desktop market first, probably until Q2 2021.

Compared to the CPU area, where Ryzen is proving to be a success, AMD seems to be moving slowly in the GPU field. The little information we have comes from leaks or analysis of future PS5 and Series X consoles.

If RDNA2 proves to be a success, do you think we will see a greater presence of AMD mobile video cards in 2021 or will NVIDIA continue to dominate the market? Smart-Shift is an interesting technology but as you well know no other laptop than DELL G5 SE will support it until next year.

Another possibility is that of a refresh of the current RDNA1 mobile gpus, perhaps with a higher amount of vram.

Amd,"I'm currently setting down the bricks to pave the way to the upcoming ZEN 3 processors. I've currently got a b350 with a 1600x in it. This and the ram are the last two things I need to upgrade to complete the build and I am currently ordering the ram but I'm curious if the thoughts on RAM capacity have changed for late 2020. Is increasing past 16gb desirable at this point? Currently running 16gb but its 2400 and I'm looking to move up to 3600, however for about the same price I could get 16gb of 16-16-16-36 3600 trident z (b-die) or I could get 32gb of 16-19-19-39 3600 (hynix). Long term, I'm wondering which one will be more beneficial. I will attempt to OC either one and I know the b-die will do better but I imagine given current circumstances I shouldn't need to get anything more than 3800 max because of matching f-clock and would think that's achievable on either stick with a good motherboard.

A modern 8 core CPU die is way bigger than what Xbox has.


So that makes me curious. How close are these cores to standard ryzen 3000 processors? It kind of looked like they must have significantly reduces instruction sets or something. Is it possible they have stripped a lot of the CPU in some way like removing complex and maybe less  needed instructions?

Amd,"Hi all,

Felt like doing a little venting. Have had Radeon VII since launch. To this day I have had to stick with 19.5.2 drivers. 

Flickering related to multiple monitors has been an issue on Radeon VII for too long. They fixed the issue with 19.5.2 then it came back a release later. Has stayed since. New features with 2020 drivers are a no go for me. 

I understand why AMD dropped this card like a hot turd. Navi was the new shiny and the money maker, Vega was the ugly step child locked in the basement. I do feel they should support their higher end parts more though. I bought the card as finally they had something that was nearly competitive with team green. But I can’t take the drivers anymore. 

Sold the VII today to a miner. He was ecstatic too get it. Told me it’s the best card for mining. Got a really good deal as well considering its 18 months old. Picked up an EVGA 2080 super. Might seem stupid considering new cards next month but EVGA’s step up program will support nicely with moving to those.

Amd,"For the future generations who might come across this in a Google Search, the answer isn't this. No, the answer is a less often discussed real regarding lowering your PPT, TDC, and EDC values in the BIOS. This in affect limits the power used by the algorithms to boost clocks, but will actually net you the better temps while affecting your temps far less.

&amp;nbsp;

The fact that nobody in this train wreck of a thread could even point to this as a better solution than what I proposed initially speaks volumes about how little people have looked into this or recommended this.

&amp;nbsp;

~~I have recently come to a conclusion with my 2600X that in an attempt to keep my system outputting less heat, that it’s just overall better to find a way to limit the voltage being pumped into my CPU, much how I’ve done with my 5700XT. To that end then, I found myself going into my motherboard BIOS and disabling some settings, and coming out with exceedingly better results than what I had initially hoped.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~It must be noted that I’m aware of the terms Precision Boost, Precision Boost Overdrive, and XFR, and at least some nuances between them. It must also be noted that I think these terms are pure marketing rubbish that serve no real purpose other than at best convince a buyer their processor is doing some sophisticated behind the scenes work, and at worst make Google searching hell.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~In my ASUS Crosshair Hero VII, I have disabled the Core Performance Boost option in both the Extreme Tweaker option and also an Advanced Menu Option (I think really just this one needs to be disabled, I think the motherboard options are goofed in this regard), which keeps the processor from automatically clocking up higher. I also disable the PBO for good measure with similar steps as noted before. I also I also have a -0.1 offset on the CPU cause that hasn’t caused me any issue at all in the months I’ve used my computer.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~What I find is that for my needs as someone who plays games, doing so has significantly reduced the heat output of my processor significantly. In repeat tests done with 3DMark TimeSpy, I see the peak temperature during the CPU benchmark phase decrease by as much as 20C and no significant drop in performance. In fact, because of the drop in temperatures from the CPU, the GPU also was cooler by 4C.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~The processor never budges from 3.6GHz and never strays from 1 Volt, and I notice appreciable drop in performance for my processor. Of course, I will note, this is then not too dissimilar from setting the CPU Core Voltage to 1 Volt and the multiplier to 36.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~I’ve been curious then with the whole of the greater Ryzen family how such findings hold up, and especially across far more varied workloads. Is it even worth letting Ryzen processors work as they are out of the box? Or is there actually greater value in taking these processors, disabling these options that say they increase performance only to find that the performance increases come at a diminishing return?~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~The purpose of this post then is to hopefully reach out and pique the curiosity of those who like to tweak their machines, those who may have far more thorough testing methodologies than me. Especially to see how this fares on newer Zen 2 processors, but especially on Zen 1.~~

&amp;nbsp;

~~My current conclusion thus far is that it is not at all worthwhile to have any performance boosting option on for the Ryzen processors, that the difference between performance at base clock and even the most modest overclock is not worthwhile at all. This isn’t a problem with Ryzen however, this is just the overall plateau of performance we find ourselves.~~","The Potential Benefits of Disabling Precision Boost and Other ""Performance Boosting"" Settings",futur gener might come across googl search answer answer less often discuss real regard lower ppt tdc edc valu bio affect limit power use algorithm boost clock actual net better temp affect temp far less nbsp fact nobodi train wreck thread could even point better solut propos initi speak volum littl peopl look recommend nbsp recent come conclus x attempt keep system output less heat overal better find way limit voltag pump much done xt end found go motherboard bio disabl set come exceedingli better result initi hope nbsp must note awar term precis boost precis boost overdr xfr least nuanc must also note think term pure market rubbish serv real purpos best convinc buyer processor sophist behind scene work worst make googl search hell nbsp asu crosshair hero vii disabl core perform boost option extrem tweaker option also advanc menu option think realli one need disabl think motherboard option goof regard keep processor automat clock higher also disabl pbo good measur similar step note also also offset caus caus issu month use comput nbsp find need someon play game significantli reduc heat output processor significantli repeat test done dmark timespi see peak temperatur benchmark phase decreas much c signific drop perform fact drop temperatur also cooler c nbsp processor never budg ghz never stray volt notic appreci drop perform processor cours note dissimilar set core voltag volt multipli nbsp curiou whole greater ryzen famili find hold especi across far vari workload even worth let ryzen processor work box actual greater valu take processor disabl option say increas perform find perform increas come diminish return nbsp purpos post hope reach piqu curios like tweak machin may far thorough test methodolog especi see fare newer zen processor especi zen nbsp current conclus thu far worthwhil perform boost option ryzen processor differ perform base clock even modest overclock worthwhil problem ryzen howev overal plateau perform find potenti benefit disabl precis boost perform boost set

I am running on an old i5-3570 which held up quite nicely till today (with just 8GB RAM, one stick only). I've been looking for news/information on the upcoming new 4th gen of Ryzen desktop CPUs but can't really find anything recent, so I don't think I want to wait 4+ months. Last thing I found was ""release september"" but that's super unlikely if there is nothing said about it since then and we're reaching september in few days.

Anyway, I could get Ryzen 5 3600 for about 161€ (190 USD) and 32GB of 3200MHz RAM for 97€ (114 USD) with a B550 mainboard like the MSI Gaming Plus for just 130€ (153$) and there is currently an offer by MSI till next week which would give me 50€ steam wallet code. So total 388€ (and 50€ free steam code). Are these good prices, worth the upgrade now or shall I Just wait for 4th gen if it ever comes?

Amd,"https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidias-first-pcie-4-0-geforce-gaming-gpu-is-mx450

Most laptops sold are between $500-$600 and historically Nvidia dominates this segment with their cheap ~25W-30W 940M, MX150, MX250, MX350 and now Turing MX450. 

While the Vega igpu in the Renoir APU is capable but those 4800U,4800H laptop does not exist in the ~$500-$600 market.  And the MX450 will be significantly faster than fastest vega igpu available right now.

This is the segment where AMD needs to fight badly to get significant market share and mind share. I know a lot of people justifying their laptop purchase must have Nvidia GPU even it is low end or entry-level than buying an igpu only laptops. And this are the people that will soon buy the MX450 even the laptops are paired with inferior intel mobile cpu.

APU with RDNA2 graphics/DDR5 are at least 1.5 years away at the earliest. 

AMD needs ~25W Turing MX450 competitor in the form of RDNA2 soon. Please.

Amd,"First and foremost- the prebuilt I bought was TRASH! It had a 2070S and a 3700X, and it was TRASH. The board was awful, the memory was slow, and the SSD wasn’t fast either. 

When I went on pcpartpicker, I found out the motherboard was $80, ram was $50, and the SSD was decent around $100. The GPU was a Zotac Gaming 2070S and was terrible. Yes it was smooth. But 100 fps on gta left some to be desired. 

I’m not sure if it was a GPU issue, or a motherboard issue. But when I went and did my own build, with a better motherboard, and a processor that’s supposed to be worse than the 2070S, I was blown away. 

On Forza 7, with 1440 I averaged anywhere between 70-100FPS with the 2070S. 

With the 5700XT Nitro+ I averaged 165, which is the refresh rate on my monitor. I had some rare drops towards 130 but nothing lower. 

On GTA the story was the same. Previously with the 2070S, I averaged anywhere between 80-120FPS.

With the Nitro+ I was mostly around 150FPS. 

I’m seriously blown away by how this was not only cheaper, but always beat down as the worse of the two. 

So, if you’re looking to get a PC soon with all the great new hardware that’s soon to be released, do yourself a favor and WAIT! Don’t grab something already made and instead do your research. I promise if I can do this, you can too. Not only will you most likely save money, but you’ll get such better parts. And learn so fucking much about your new passion. 

One thing to disclose, is that the 2070S did have ray tracing on. I honestly never noticed it working as I typically play online in BR or other FPS. I think that could contribute to the change in FPS. BUT, that Zotac card would be 80c at the EDGE just trying to push 1900MHZ, where the Nitro+ can push 2GHZ all day and sit at 60c edge. 

I seriously can’t believe how awesome this thing runs and that it’s from a company worth significantly less than Nvidia. 

Anyways, my build is:

O11 Dynamic
G.Skill Ripjawz 3600 16GB

Amd,"While reading about the Renoir apu and how close it is in performance to the 3600 Zen2 series, I thought about the ""old days""  when a lot of the IO was done on the north bridge and south bridge chips  before the chip-makers started moving everything onto the cpu itself. With the chiplet design, and the speed of PCIE-4 and PCIE-5 (and higher), would it make sense to move most of the IO back and just have the smaller cpu chiplets on the cpu itself?  Maybe the higher latency would destroy any possible benefits.

Amd,"Hello! Forgive me if this wasn't the right place for brand discussion.

So I recently built my PC and bought the RX570 Asrock Phantom Gaming D 4GB. It produces a checkerboard artifact within a week of operation, which doesn't last long and only happens during startup. I further detailed these woes on a post you can see on my history, but long story short, I RMAd the card.

The seller has checked and confirmed that the product was fine, there's no defect and they couldn't reproduce the checkerboard there, but they still allowed the refund, so now I'm again in need of a GPU. I'm currently in Japan, so there's quite a limited choice on the budget GPU side of things. There's only the Phantom Gaming D for the RX570, the one I bought previously, and the pricing for the rest is just isn't viable, in a sense that I could just get RX580 with the same price.

Now the RX580 have three choices, the Kurotoshikou brand, local Japanese brand, the MSI Armor, and the ASRock Phantom Gaming D

I could not properly troubleshoot the checkerboard, so I'm really skeptical about the ASRock brand, either due to BIOS mismatch or conflict with mobo (B450 Tomahawk MAX and Ryzen 3 3100), while I have seen rather negative sayings about the MSI Armor, particularly about the heating. There are not many reviews I could find about the Kurotoshikou, but I'm quite skeptical about the build quality. [Here is the product btw](https://www.kuroutoshikou.com/product/graphics_bord/rd-rx580-e8gb/)

TL;DR ASRock gave me checkerboard, so I'm skeptical if it's just one product defect or incompatibility, but I need new RX580 GPU, either from ASRock, MSI, or Kurotoshikou

Amd," 

Hey everyone, this is going to be my first build and I was wondering what cooling is necessary. I am not overclocking, but I will be gaming and rendering video, effects, etc. I know Noctua NH-D15 gets a lot of praise despite how ugly the default colors look. I am wondering if a cooler that big is overkill? Like would I ***need*** that much of a cooler or one similar like the dark rock pro 4 or others. For me, Noctua is frustrating because I want the cooler and the reputation, but I don't want the brown fans. Trying to find the right black fans to replace smaller coolers is a pain. But I wonder if it is worth it.

I would be spending more money for the looks to get let's say a Noctua NH-D15S or even a base D15 rather than just going with the new black and replacing the fans. Is the D15S even too much for a general gaming/video rendering/work/internet surfing machine? I know the wraith actually works fairly well given it is stock, but I want a bit better of an air cooler without going AIO.

Does anyone have any insight? Yes, I know case, mesh front, and case fans all temperatures all factor into the overall temp, but I am talking more in general. I see a lot of people in the comments and other places recommending the D15, but I don't know if they are overclocking or what exactly to justify that big ass cooler.

If anyone knows what fans to buy for replacement for other Noctua models, then I am all ears. Also, I am open to suggestions for other air coolers. I find ones I like, but they get not so stellar reviews. I will buy standard or ARGB if it is the right one.

Amd," If you are in a dilemma over whether to choose B550 or B450 chipset or you are curious about the differences between B550 and B450, this post is right for you and it will show you [**AMD B550 vs B450 chipset comparison**](https://www.shareus.com/computer/amd-b550-vs-b450-chipset-comparison-is-b550-worth-it.html) from all aspects..

 Here’s a table about the comparison of key specifications of B550 vs B450 chipset. 

https://preview.redd.it/0tgzkma65gj51.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1aea2b1d2930e38fca2928f66d96903cc3c3ba8

 As can be seen from the table, the main differences between B550 and B450 include **PCIe Gen**, **network speed**, and **multi-GPU**. Moreover, they have different compatibility with Ryzen processors though they have the same socket type. Apart from these, there are little differences in other specifications such as RAID Support, StoreMI and the number of SATA 3.0 and USB. Let’s take a closer look at the differences between B550 and B450 chipset.

## 1. B550 vs B450: PCIe Gen

The most significant difference between B550 vs B450 is PCIe 4.0. PCIe 4.0 has already been a trend in computer development and the ultra-high transmission rate of PCIe 4.0 interface can dramatically improve the performance of devices such as graphics card and hard disk. B550 chipset possesses PCIe 4.0 x4 M.2 slot for SSDs and PCIe 4.0 x16 slot to make full use of graphics card, but the general purpose PCIe lanes and CPU chipset uplink use PCIe 3.0 instead, which is also an upgrade over B450 chipset. B450 chipset only offers PCIe 3.0 slot for graphics card and SSDs and PCIe 2.0 general purpose lanes.

## 2. B550 vs B450: Compatibility

When it comes to the compatibility with AMD Ryzen CPU, B450 chipset is superior to B550. B550 chipset is prepared for Ryzen 3000 processors and the upcoming AMD Ryzen desktop processors with the Zen 3 Architecture (Ryzen 4000 processors). However, AMD said that B550 chipset isn't compatible with Ryzen 1000/2000 processors or Ryzen 3000 APUs like Ryzen 3 3200G and Ryzen 5 3400G. And whereas B450 chipset supports all Ryzen series (Ryzen 1000/2000/3000 processors). Besides, Beta BIOS updates will open up Zen 3 support for B450 chipset, which means that most (not all) B450 motherboards will support Ryzen 4000 processors but with some features missing. So, when choosing B550 or B450, it is necessary to consider its compatibility with Ryzen processors.

## 3. B550 vs B450: Network Speed

With the addition of PCIe 4.0, one of the dramatical improvements in AMD B550 chipset is network speed. In term of wired network, The LAN speed of B550 chipset is increased from 1 Gbps (the LAN speed of B450) to 2.5Gbps. As for wireless network, B550 chipset supports WIFI 6 (aka 802.11 ax) while B450 chipset only supports IEEE 802.11ac. So, the wireless speed of B550 chipset is much more powerful than that of B450. But having said that, most users don’t have a fast-enough internet connection to saturate 1 Gbps and the network speed supported by B450 chipset is powerful enough for most users. So, the improvement of network speed between B550 and B450 does not have much impact on most users.

## 4. B550 vs B450: Multi-GPU

A slight difference between B550 and B450 chipset is multi-GPU support. B550 chipset features support for AMD CrossFire and NVIDIA SLI and whereas B450 only supports AMD CrossFire. But frankly speaking, this technology is dispensable for most computer users. Because the performance of single GPU is powerful enough and fewer and fewer games support multi-GPU configurations nowadays.

## 5. B550 vs B450: VRM and cooling

Another upgrade in B550 chipset is VRM and cooling system, which means that it is more excellent in thermal performance. But it only matters when you match it with a high-end Ryzen 7 or 9 processor or you plan to overclock. Otherwise, there is no need to consider this aspect.

## Bottom Line: Is B550 worth it?

To summarize, compared to B450 chipset, B550 chipset has a certain degree of improvement in some specifications like PCIe 4.0 and network speed. But generally speaking, these improvements don’t have much effect in real-world performance and practicality. Besides, B450 chipset has much better compatibility with AMD Ryzen processors and value for money (about $50 saved). The release of B550 doesn't mean that B450 chipset has been phased out and the features of B450 chipset are still powerful enough for most users. Thus, from my perspective, B550 chipset is not a good choice unless you are intended to build a future-proof platform for Ryzen 4000 processors and enthusiastic about PCIe Gen 4 GPU or SSD (PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD).",AMD B550 vs B450 Chipset Comparison,dilemma whether choos b b chipset curiou differ b b post right show b vs b chipset comparison shareu comput b vs b chipset comparison b worth html aspect tabl comparison key specif b vs b chipset preview redd tgzkma gj png width format png auto webp e aea b e fca f cc c ba seen tabl main differ b b includ pcie gen network speed multi moreov differ compat ryzen processor though socket type apart littl differ specif raid support storemi number sata usb let take closer look differ b b chipset b vs b pcie gen signific differ b vs b pcie pcie alreadi trend comput develop ultra high transmiss rate pcie interfac dramat improv perform devic graphic card hard disk b chipset possess pcie x slot ssd pcie x slot make full use graphic card gener purpos pcie lane chipset uplink use pcie instead also upgrad b chipset b chipset offer pcie slot graphic card ssd pcie gener purpos lane b vs b compat come compat ryzen b chipset superior b b chipset prepar ryzen processor upcom ryzen desktop processor zen architectur ryzen processor howev said b chipset compat ryzen processor ryzen apu like ryzen g ryzen g wherea b chipset support ryzen seri ryzen processor besid beta bio updat open zen support b chipset mean b motherboard support ryzen processor featur miss choos b b necessari consid compat ryzen processor b vs b network speed addit pcie one dramat improv b chipset network speed term wire network lan speed b chipset increas gbp lan speed b gbp wireless network b chipset support wifi aka ax b chipset support ieee ac wireless speed b chipset much power b said user fast enough internet connect satur gbp network speed support b chipset power enough user improv network speed b b much impact user b vs b multi slight differ b b chipset multi support b chipset featur support crossfir sli wherea b support crossfir frankli speak technolog dispens comput user perform singl power enough fewer fewer game support multi configur nowaday b vs b vrm cool anoth upgrad b chipset vrm cool system mean excel thermal perform matter match high end ryzen processor plan overclock otherwis need consid aspect bottom line b worth summar compar b chipset b chipset certain degre improv specif like pcie network speed gener speak improv much effect real world perform practic besid b chipset much better compat ryzen processor valu money save releas b mean b chipset phase featur b chipset still power enough user thu perspect b chipset good choic unless intend build futur proof platform ryzen processor enthusiast pcie gen ssd pcie nvme ssd b vs b chipset comparison

Amd,"Hi, 
just found a way to increase FPS in FS2020 in cockpit and external view.
My FPS was around 25-30 with custom tuned settings, not using presets. Anyhow that does not make much of a difference...
What makes a difference are some of the UI windows while playing FS2020. 
For example the camera and weather ui window (even if minimized) will slow down FPS in general massively.
Do this for each of the mentioned windows.
1. click the middle ""square"" in the top right side of the window title to maximize the window
2. in my case the window title changes from FS2020 ui design to Windows 10 window title design
3. click minimize the window
4. check FPS

I had MSI afterburner active to check FPS, perhaps it had something to do with the window design change or not.

Amd,"I've been struggling with this problem for months trying to figure out why is it that my 3950x will not idle properly. After finally realizing that Chroma Visualizer is the culprit.

It's easy guys. Just run Ryzen master. Look at all your cores, they will not go to sleep as long as Chroma Visualizer is resident in your memory. Go shut it down manually in your resource monitor and you will start seeing your idle cores goto sleep one by one. For some reason, Chroma Visualizer wakes every core that's available to get itself working.

It took me 2 months of research and even that I couldn't find an answer, long story short, after massive trial and errors I was able to figure this out on my own.

Synapse 3 sucks (actually just Chroma Visualizer), I honestly don't think you need to wake 18 CPUs to light up some RGB.

In the end, I uninstalled just the Chroma Visualizer Module alone and kept everything else. Everything works as intended now and I'm able to see 9 cores (18 out of 32threads) goto sleep properly. I couldn't believe my eyes as it was the first time seeing my vCore dip below 1.0 as I have never seen it dip below 1.2 before removing Chroma Visualizer. It definitely felt great.

I hope this post helps someone.","Ryzen 9 3900x/3950x won't idle properly, finally figured out why.",struggl problem month tri figur x idl properli final realiz chroma visual culprit easi guy run ryzen master look core go sleep long chroma visual resid memori go shut manual resourc monitor start see idl core goto sleep one one reason chroma visual wake everi core avail get work took month research even find answer long stori short massiv trial error abl figur synaps suck actual chroma visual honestli think need wake cpu light rgb end uninstal chroma visual modul alon kept everyth els everyth work intend abl see core thread goto sleep properli believ eye first time see vcore dip never seen dip remov chroma visual definit felt great hope post help someon ryzen x x idl properli final figur

Amd,"Hi everyone,

I just build a new PC and I am hitting 93c for a moment while gaming. The normal range is 70-85 with a few spikes going higher every once in a while (like once every 10-20 minutes or so). While doing about anything else I don't get those temps but I am not doing anything that is really taxing the system either besides gaming.

I have:

1. loosen and re-tighten the screws
2. I added another intake fan in the front and an exhaust fan at the top
3. I set the fan speeds to increase at a lower temp (100% fan power while 75c and higher) 

I still get these spikes in temp that hit into the 90c after doing the above. Game play is mostly smooth.

Is it time to pull the heat sync off, wipe everything clean, and then reapply some paste? Any advice is appreciated! 

In case it is needed, here are my specs:

* Ryzen 3600x (stock speeds)
* Wraith Spire Cooler
* GIGABYTE X570 AORUS PRO WiFi
* Thermaltake ToughPower 750W 80 Plus Gold
* WD Blue 3D NAND 1TB sata ssd
* Kingston Digital 480GB SSDNow UV400
* Kingston Digital 120GB SSDNow V300
* Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3000MHz C15 (3000MHz speeds)
* ASUS Radeon RX Vega 64 (undervolt)

Sensors on the motherboard

1. Temperature #1 49c (max)
2. Temperature #3 93c (max)
3. Temperature #4 61c (max)
4. Temperature #5 56c (max)
5. Temperature #6 66c (max)

Sensors on the processor:

1. CPU Package 93.1c (max)

GPU Sensor temps:

1. 76c (max)
2. CPU CCD #1 c (max)

Update: i reapplied the thermal paste and took the vcore from auto to normal. Loading into windows seems to have lower temps than before. Time to test this in some Metro!

Probably the last update:

I have been messing around with it more. The four things I did are:

1. Re-applying the CPU paste (the *old-try-and-true* spread the paste evenly with a plastic bag over the finger)
2. Adding another intake fan in the front and adding an exhaust fan at the top
3. Setting the VCore on the possessor to Normal instead of Auto (noticeable performance gain)
4. Removing the top cover of the case. It is a little louder but now temps are mostly in the 70c's with the highest being 82.5c (this finally got ride of the high temp spikes)

Amd,"PSA:  If you want to run a multi-monitor setup in Flight Simulator, but have monitors with different native resolutions, then the eyefinity ""quick setup"" option in AMD's driver software will set up the array with same vertical resolution for both monitors (e.g., a 2160p monitor and a 1440p monitor will both have 1440 pixels vertically).  The problem here is that you'll have black bars on the monitor(s) that have higher native resolution, and there's no screen fill option in the normal driver software.

Fortunately, under C:\Program Files\AMD\CNext\CNext (unless you have a different install directory) you can find a program called ""EyefinityPro.""  This fortunately gives the ability to fill the screens of higher resolution monitors.

I now have my triple monitor setup running on my RX 5700 XT at 7,680 x 1440 without any issues (other than Flight Simulator being extremely demanding).  Given the massive number of pixels here (33% more than 4k), I have to turn the settings down to medium (other than object and terrain detail, which I keep at 100) with 60% render scaling to maintain my target ~30 fps.  I'm definitely looking forward the the next generation of graphics cards...

Building a new rig soon, but my wife needs the current PC when she starts a computing course at the start of October, so i'm very limited for time frame.

Assuming the 4000 series isnt released by then, if I was to prebuild everything but the CPU (and GPU - but I do have a spare tucked away that will do just to get video output), what would be the cheapest one to pair with a B550 board? I've seen some info about older chipsets working, but officially only supports 3000+?

The 3000g would have been perfect but I understand that's not supported due to being an older chipset, despite the 3xxx naming?

Will only need it for web browser as I work from home via Citrix connection so doesn't need to be powerful, purely a stop gap before 4xxx comes out however long that is.

Alternatively, the X570 seems to be a bit more compatible, would going for that + older 2xxx series be more the way to go?

Still slightly hypothetical as we don't have dates yet, but just covering bases.

I am looking to update my old [i7-4820K](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/77781/intel-core-i7-4820k-processor-10m-cache-up-to-3-90-ghz.html) &amp; [ASUS X79 DELUXE LGA 2011](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813132047?&amp;quicklink=true) to an AMD CPU &amp; MOBO. I'm excited for the Ryzen 3000 series and have been doing my research to price out a reasonable upgrade.

I am mainly looking to choose between a Ryzen 7 3700X or a Ryzen 9 3900X(T). But the deal is I have about a $600-ish budget. Do I go for the 3700X and spend $300 on a kick ass ASROCK X570 Taichi? (Possible CPU upgrade room for Zen 3?) or would it benefit me more to pay more for the 3900X(T) and buy the best $150 x570/X470 I can find? I will be doing some overclocking and purchasing a more aggressive RAM setup in the future.

I use my PC as an all around production / gaming rig. I am focusing away from games and more towards production, but I still want to be able to game when I fancy. :)

So I bring up the question, should I choose a balanced CPU/MOBO @ $300/$300? spend more on the CPU and go for more of a $500/$100 affair? Should I even upgrade at all?

I hope you are all saying well and healthy! I appreciate the feedback.

Sincerely,

OongBak",Making the switch to AMD.

Amd,"**DISCLAIMER: I do NOT recommend ""overclocking"" your GPU, or using 3rd party software to modify your GPU's BIOS. Doing so can be dangerous and/or fatal to your hardware and should only even be attempted for testing purposes. I am not responsible for any damage or subsequent issues caused to your system if you decide to attempt this solution.**

&amp;#x200B;

So I was having a lot of issues with black screen ""crashes"" when gaming. Much like others had reported, I would be playing a game sometimes for as little as 1 minute and, boom, black screen but still audio intact as if the driver just quit or something. Sometimes CTRL-SHFT-WNDW-B would bring the screen back long enough to get out of the game, but other times it didn't help and I would be forced to hard shutdown the computer. Now I have ""solved"" this.... sort of.... it's certainly not a quick ""change this setting and you're good to go"" type of solution, but it's not too terribly complicated as long as you are somewhat tech savvy. Basically what I did was turn the ""Link State Power Management"" setting completely OFF. Then what I did was use MorePowerTools and GPU-Z to ""tweak"" the cards perceived parameters. You typically use said software for overclocking, but I simply used it to trick the GPU into thinking it had significantly more clock speed headroom so that it doesn't think its over utilizing. I did this by upping the perceived GFX clock speed and by also upping the TDP and power usage to figures well higher than the parameters it sees from the factory. Finally, I tested everything using RDR2 benchmark in bith Vulkan and DX12 and found that the issue was still occasionally present in Vulkan (just occasional stutters) and gone entirely when using DX12. Now just to reiterate, I am NOT suggesting overclocking and using this software very well may void your warranty (although I am not 100%) and therefore I can't say you should do this, but I wanted to share this information because to me it seems like something that AMD may be able to benefit from knowing and possibly fix in a software and/or driver update.

Amd,"Hey everyone,

New to this subrreddit and recently dipped my toes into building my PC last year. I was looking to upgrade my Ryzen 3 2200g and I purchased a Ryzen 7 3700x a week ago. I received it yesterday and a buddy of mine is recommending me to return it and wait for the Zen 3, which is rumored to come out later this year. I just wanted to reach out to this community and get some more insight. 

Would Zen 3 be significantly better than Zen 2?

I have a Prime B450M-A motherboard. It is an entry level board. Would it support Zen 3?

When next gen CPUs get released, does the existing gen typically get a price cut? If I can save a decent amount by waiting then I would consider that too.

Thanks for the advice!

So I've got myself a beast of a laptop - mainly due to me working in IT and being stuck at a desk all day. I wanted to relax on my couch and be with the missus.

I've been going through the posts by Rob @ AMD regarding voltages and idle, and it's very informative (it's also changed my outlook with overclocking.)

Anyway. My CPU idles perfectly fine, gets to the lowest it can for a laptop (47c) with voltages dipping below 0.9 when idle.

When running Cinebench (getting 4600+ consistently,) I've noticed my CPU maxes out between 87-91c (with all fans @ 100%)

Is this to be expected due to the limited airflow and being a laptop? I know that Cinebench stresses the CPU far more than games ever will, so just want other people's take / experience.

Amd,"It's a shame that AMD hasn't had anything even close to competitive in terms of AVC and HEVC Encoding Quality compared to that of Turing, or even Pascal including late release Maxwell-B for that matter.

Does AMD ever plan on addressing this portion of their Video Card offerings ?

I am not a Gamer yet like me there are probably many out there that are forced to purchase at least 1 Nvidia GPU if using hardware accelerated video encoding on their workstations and in some cases, may purchase more from Nvidia if running something like a Plex Server if interested in using it's hardware accelerated real-time stream transcoding in order to serve formats and sizes to satisfy the entire family, or all of their devices.

This can't simply be an oversight, considering even Intel offered QuickSync AVC hardware encoding on all 14nm CPUs with iGPUs that rivaled Pascal's AVC performance and quality. Now as it seems, Turing for both AVC and HEVC codecs is in a league of it's own. Turing's HEVC encoding is indistinguishable from pure CPU encoding in terms of quality and at many times the speed.

The Turing encoder is available on every card from the 1650Super, up to the current flagship, so one can't even call it a 'Premium Feature'.

Amd,"So my current system is running an 8700k (oc 4.9ghz) and a 1080Ti. I'm likely going to buy one of the RTX 3000 series GPU's on launch either 3080 or 90 depending on pricing ect...

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at the 3900XT and while its obviously a far more capable CPU in terms of productivity in gaming its margin of error with a stock 8700k in most games. The main reason why im looking at a CPU upgrade is because of PCIe 4.0. By the looks of it, the new cards are going to be powerful enough to where PCIe 4.0 is going to start to matter for GPU's now. But in terms of ONLY gaming performance on the CPU it doesn't seem that any of the 3000 parts are much of an upgrade over an 8700k.

&amp;#x200B;

With that, whats the expected performance improvement in gaming of Ryzen 4000 going to be? I've seen Linus a few times say that he expects it to be quite the leap but I haven't really heard more than that on the subject, is there any more indication yet?

Amd,"Hello, I previously made a post [deciding between RX 580 and Gigabyte Vega 56](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ibvhpl/used_rx_580_vs_vega_56_gigabyte_oc_card/). I thought I'd get the RX 580 but I came across a used Vega 56 (Sapphire Vega 56, the blower style card).

He is willing to sell it for 14k INR \~188 USD. Which is slightly more expensive than the 11k \~148USD for the RX 580.

My concerns -

1. Vega 56 card just finished it's warranty and the card is 3 years old, first hand card though
2. Vega 56 requires 2x 8 pin connectors while my current PSU (Cooler Master Thunder 450 Watt) has only a single 6+2 pin connector.
3. If the card doesn't work with a single 8 pin connector, I will have to upgrade my PSU. Currently I'm looking at Gigabyte GH700 PSU which will cost me 5.5k \~74 USD
4. The RX 580 card comes with 6 months warranty and model is Asus Dual RX 580

In terms of PSU upgrade, total price for Vega route to around 262 USD or 19.5k INR, which is more than the 11k I will be paying for the RX 580.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm restricted to a 900p 60hz monitor, so my question as mentioned above in point 2, is whether I can run the card with single 8pin if I reduce the graphic details while gaming. I don't mind getting my hands dirty and tweaking/undervolting and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Would RX 580 still be the better choice? In a few months I'll upgrade to 1080p 144hz monitor for gaming. I would like to maintain 144hz in as many games as possible, or at least close to 60 fps.

* Game profiles are also a buggy mess. Disabling zero RPM mode on the global profile only works until the computer is rebooted. Then, you have to toggle it on and off again for it to work. And if you set a custom curve for a particular game (if you don't mind the fan jumping between 2 points every 15 seconds) there is a random chance it won't change back to your global settings. The only way to fix it is by selecting the global in the control panel and viewing the tuning profile resulting in the immediate violent ramping of the fan from xxxx rpm to ZERO regardless of the selected setting.

So I just recently bought a new Ryzen 3700X on Amazon and here's my build.

MSI Gaming Plus B350 (yes, I'm planning to upgrade to an X570 soon)  
Coolermaster MasterElite 240, all case fans set at full speed  
32GB DDR4 3200Mhz (16-18-18-38 at 1.350v)  
Radeon Vega 64  
600w PSU  
NZXT S340 Elite case

I've been manually overclocking my previous R7 1700 in the BIOS to get the most stable overclock and now that I switched to the newer gen Ryzen, I'm kinda confused because most forums say that we don't want to overclock the 7nm chip and instead run everything on stock and turn on PBO. 

I've manually turned off PBO and set my clock speeds manually to 4.3Ghz with 1.244v.

So far that's the most stable overclock I've tested in this build. 

Temps on idle at 35-42C, temps under normal load (chrome, discord, slack, office tools) at 45-60C. 

Temp at full load running Prime95 after 30 mins at 75C. 

Ambient temp: 25C.

My questions are:

1. Is this a good overclock and Cinebench scores? MultiCPU at 5126
2. Is this a good temp? 
3. Should I worry about CPU degragation? I want to leave it overclock and run my PC almost 24hrs a day. Mostly light tasks open in the background.
4. How bad is it to run a ryzen 7 3700X on a B350?

Amd,"So have a friend who is about to buy my current 2070 non super. I've been debating for a while of swapping to a matching AMD Gpu naming the 5700xt especially with the 2 game deal going on currently. I'm not going towait for the rtx 3k series due to availability at launch, pricing, and the new connection. (I'll wait for things to break out and get tested) 
So the general issue: I can snag a 5700xt locally for 399, the closest 2070 super is 125 more. 2080 supers hit 650 before tax, pushing it out of my window sadly.

Amd,"Hi everyone,

Today I exchanged i7 4790 to

Ryzen 5 3600 + MSI B450 Tomahawk Max and 2x8 GB kit Corsair 3200mhz CL16


I had only time to start it up, install new W10 and all works.

Saw idle 56-60°C
When I played a game for few minutes I saw max 68°C (have really awesome airflow)

BUT in bios I saw:

CPU: 3.6Ghz
DDR: 2133mhz
VCore: 1.46-1.477

1) How to unlock DDR4 full potential to 3200mhz?

2) Why do I have such a high VCore? Or is it normal?

3) If I want to Over Clock how to do it? Should I lower VCore too?

Amd,"Hopefully someone here can help me out.  I hope I've come to the right place for guidance.  I plan on building a PC for gaming/streaming/content creation.  I'm upgrading from an Intel i7-3820 (quad core, 2012) to a Ryzen 4000 series processor (HUGE upgrade, finally).  This is my first AMD PC, as well as the first PC I personally build (the i7 is a pre-built from CyberPower).  My budget is \~2.5k.  Realistically, I'll most likely go over this budget since I hear the new high-end NVIDIA cards will be around 1.4k alone.  I don't really care about optics.  Performance and value is all I'm really looking for.  After many, many hours on forums and watching YouTube vids on air vs liquid cooling, differences in RAM, the importance of air flow in cases, etc., here are the options I've rallied:

CPU         - Ryzen 4000 TBD.  I'm thinking 12 cores.    
Cooling  - Corsair H150i PRO Liquid  
MOBO    - MSI x570 Tomahawk WiFi  
GPU        - NVIDIA RTX 3000 TBD  
Case        - Lian Li Lancool II Mesh / Phanteks P400A RGB / Phanteks P500A Digital  
RAM        - G.Skill Trident Z Neo 64 GB (4x16 GB) 3600 MHz CL 16  
SSD         - Corsair MP600 Gen4 2 TB M.2 NVME  
PSU         - EVGA SuperNOVA G1+ 1000 W 80+ Gold  
Fans        - Noctua NF-A12x25 120mm (x2)

Why I made these choices:  
**CPU** \- Ryzen dominates price to performance over Intel right now, so this one is a no-brainer.  I also wanted to upgrade at the start of a new architecture so I could upgrade 3-4 years down the road if I wanted to without having to switch motherboards.    
**Cooling** \- I plan on overclocking, so I wanted the best cooling solution possible, and I've read that the H150i is great value for performance.  I looked into air cooling, but most of my research led to liquid cooling for high-end systems.  
**MOBO** \- The Tomahawk is the best budget x570 on the market right now.  This is the only item on my list that is set in stone.  This is 100% the MOBO I'm purchasing.  
**GPU** \- 1440p 165fps gaming / video editing.  My ASUS ROG PG279QZ has been waiting to get properly utilized.  I may flex to an AMD GPU if the performance is right.  I'll most likely purchase my GPU last since there isn't much information on next gen GPU's yet.  My 1070ti can hold me off for another year or so.  
**CASE** \- I hear all of these are pretty fantastic for air flow.  Which do you recommend?  
**RAM** \- I've read that 3200 MHz CL16 RAM is the sweet spot for current Ryzen, so I'm assuming 3600 MHz CL 16 will be the sweet spot for Ryzen 4000?  I've also heard mixed opinions on 4x memory (16 GB x 4) vs 2x memory (32 GB x 2) on a dual channel board. This one has me totally stumped.   
**SSD** \- I wanted to take advantage of PCIe 4.0 for faster video editing and rendering, so I just chose a random SSD since they're all roughly the same price for 2 TB.  Is investing in a PCIe 4.0 SSD worth it for content creation or should I stick with a high-end PCIe 3.0 SSD?  If I need additional ""normal"" storage, I was thinking of the Intel 660p since I've heard it's great value for the ""everyday"" user.  
**PSU** \- I've heard that current high end systems are recommended \~750 W power supplies, so I'm assuming next gen will require more.  The EVGA was a PSU that was both highly rated and relatively budget friendly.  Thoughts?  
**Fans** \- Additional case fans with high performance and little noise.  I read that some Arctic fans are also really good and 1/3 the price but wear out much faster.  After 8 years, my current PC is embarrassingly noisy at times, despite me cleaning it pretty often.  

This post is so long &gt;.&lt;.  I really hope there's an experienced builder out there that can help me.  If you were building a really high-end PC while still trying to remain as wallet-friendly as possible, would these be your choices?

Amd,"I have a general understanding of what they do:

Freesync, prevents tearing, adjusts refresh to output, improves game appearance

Virtual Super Resolution, renders at higher resolution, e.g., 4K, then downsampled to native, e.g., FHD to improve image quality

Vari-Bright, to save battery, the panel will dim but boost brightness to compensate.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is for a 2020 HP Envy X360 with 4700U and the 400-nit display.  My use case does not include gaming at all, but I do watch 60FPS videos and like smooth motion and good video quality.  I believe the bottleneck to smooth video is the LCD panel response time regardless of refresh.  However...

\&gt; Will Freesync help my use case?  Does it consume more battery?  What are the disadvantages of enabling it?

\&gt; Same question goes for Virtual Super Resolution.  I presume it will consume more resources and battery when playing a video at 4K and have the GPU downsample, but is it worth doing?  For local 4K files on a FHD panel, doesn't the player by default downsample it to FHD anyway?

\&gt;I was not impressed with Vari-Bright.  It degrades picture quality from what I can tell.  I know disabling probably uses more power, but I can live with it.  I would like to know if I am missing anything or reasons why I should use Vari-Bright.

Many thanks.","Laptop: Freesync, Virtual Super Resolution, Vari-Bright, enable or not?

Amd,"My friend needed a new laptop for school/DJing/music production so we went to Best Buy yesterday, and he was deciding between an Omen with a Ryzen 7 4800H (8 core) and an ROG with a Core i7 10750H (6 core), both with 1660TI’s.  He said a Best Buy rep at a different store told him “Ryzen has better single-core performance but Intel cores work better together so they’re stronger for multiple tasks at once so you’d be better off with a Core i7.”  We talked to a rep at this Best Buy and he said the exact same thing, but also said that “Intel and Nvidia love each other (exact words) so the i7 is gonna do better when you’re doing something that uses the graphics card.”  I’m a computer engineering major so I think I know a little bit about CPU architecture, and I thought that even with Intel’s slight edge in single-core performance there’s no way a 6-core i7 can be better for multi-threaded tasks than an 8-core Ryzen 7 clocked slightly higher right?  Unless I’m losing my mind, it seems like Best Buy is telling its employees to give inaccurate information about Intel and AMD CPUs, presumably to sell more Intel-based computers.

Amd,"With the recent hype in MSFS 2020 after a decade hiatus, people have been talking about MSFS nonestop for the last couple of days and especially about it's lack of Optimization and poor performance on strong rigs. The new ""Will it run Crysis in ultra settings"" of the modern era. However, there was something else lurking around the corner that had the **exact same** woes as MSFS 2020 and that is DCS World, which is the topic of my argument today:

[Here's what DCS world is for the curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH7eH98iutc) (especially if you have an affinity to play flight sims - but have never heard of this game because of their poor marketing unless you stumble upon a video on youtube). 

[Here's some more eye-candy for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWN5R7tRMws) 

But I am here to say that DCS has been around since LOMAC (Lock On Modern Air Combat); which is in fact the predecessor to DCS - made by the same people and uses the same legacy code! But....... once I got into this game (and specifically got into it for VR - which is amazing), I found the dark side of flight sims these days, which enables DCS players to empathize with the pains of gamers who are used to playing optimized games suddenly getting exposed to the vicious demands of MSFS 2020:


DCS is a very unoptimized game so whatever you know about benchmarks and AAA game performance, put it aside. That being said, the game doesn't have a lot of benchmarks and the people that do dive into it are Intel users.....because the **game is single-core driven and Intel wins in that department, hands down.** This game is sooooo poorly optimized that people with i9's, 2080ti and 32 GB of RAM sometimes get 45 fps for no reason. So, lower your expectations heading into this game (it's not your fault, the devs of this game are slow in implementing the latest and greatest systems and mostly just rely on small patches every week to make things work - which sometimes breaks everything). I am a wiki contributor about this exact matter hence I spent about 5 months just researching a good build for DCS and I hear people say that if you want to build a PC for DCS, go big or expect a laggy, slow, and crash-laden game. 

In layman's terms, this game has 2 premises, and it's up to you to decide how to go about that: With VR in mind or without VR (or just Track IR). 

If you have VR in mind, don't cheap out. Go big or expect a subpar game. Here are my minimum recommended specs for a good VR DCS build:

1. 32 gb ram, overclocked. if ryzen, then 3200mhz. With intel, you can be flexible. Aim for lower latency as well. On an empty mission in SP, MSI afterburner showed that this game uses a whopping 21 GB! This will cause people with 16 GB to crash their game or sometimes, Windows even. 

2. 1080 and up. Or 2070 Super and up. Or 5700 and up (preferably XT). The trick is the VRAM; the higher the better.

3. Any CPU that can pump out 4.7 Ghz at least while stable (every core). If you go with a Ryzen, 3600x and up. For intel, the i5 9600k can do that with a good cooler. **This is the argument.** On an empty mission, in a less demanding map, on a simple low-fidelity aircraft, on SP, MSI afterburner showed me that my 4.7 Ghz overclock of my intel 9600k was running right at 4695 Ghz; right up there! This makes intel the clear winner here because it can overclock a single core to 5 ghz easily and DCS will use up all of that. I am pretty sure that the same thing happens to MSFS 2020. This makes it much harder for cheaper but multi-threading AMD CPU's to win, especially in a game where VR makes so much sense and even the VR adds to the overhead in the CPU processing. ***See the Note at the bottom*

4. Game needs to be on an SSD otherwise, none of that will matter!

But without VR or just Track IR in mind:

You can go cheap. I recommend that you get more monitors or get a large size monitor or ones that curve. 

1. 32 gb is still recommended (for heavy missions) or MP

2. You can make due with even a GTX 1650 Super or higher. 

3. The Ryzen 3600 or higher. Overclocking will give you an extra safety margin for sure. 

4. Game still needs to be on an SSD.

I think that this setup currently for DCS (yes, currently, after about 12 years in existence as the name DCS and not LOMAC:Flaming Cliffs 3), is the perfect setup for MSFS 2020 currently, and one that can learn from the future optimizations of each other (both run on DX11 - DCS has Vulkan in its pipeline, but no ETA has been announced). 

Some more about DCS, to butter your bread: 

DCS is **free** and comes with 2 low fidelity aircraft right off the bat; the gun-less P-51 and the Su-25T. From there, you can purchase maps (Syria is the newest one - others include Persian Gulf, Nevada, Normandy - and the Falklands is coming up), assets, campaigns and a range of high fidelity helos and planes. 

High fidelity means clickable cockpits, highly accurate systems to the real thing, and highly realistic flight models. [Here, take a look for yourself](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/planes/).

There are more planes and helos in the pipleline, including the high fidelity version of the Mig-23, Mi-24 hind, F-15E, F-14A, and F-8 Crusader. Planes that are high fidelity in DCS are listed in that list except the Su-27/33, Mig-29, F-15C, A-10A, and Su-25. 

If you are wondering how your system should look like to make a VR build for either sims, this is my minimum recommended build for DCS, which I think should give you 45-55 fps in VR, which is absolutely enough and absolutely amazing in DCS. **I have never heard anyone going beyond 90 fps in VR in DCS.** [PCPartPicker Part List - Intel Build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rkFm6R) or [PCPartPicker Part List - Ryzen Build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/fXCmYH)

DCS has both a Steam version and also a standalone version - but the standalone version gets more sales and offers and has the Open Beta version which gets more patches and weekly updates than the stable version (both are unoptimized anyway).

Amd,"I've been sitting on a 6700k for years now and let me tell you, video editing got really sucky the past couple of years. I've been itching to get something with more cores all year, but the longer I wait the more I realize how big of an impact DDR5 capability will likely have on my productivity. 

Sad thing is, I still use this computer for photoshop a lot and having this thing overclocked to 4.8ghz has prolonged its usefulness beyond the need for upgrade. It just really sucks when I crack open adobe premiere and I spend half a day rendering files. I'd get more mileage out of a newer intel CPU because of its optimization, but it'll also be a cold day in hell if I get another one of those considering how late to the game they are in every other aspect.

So I'm at the point where I'm trying to figure out what I can do now with the motherboards and chips that are available today.

One thing I'm sure of is that an x570 board will do me a lot of good when pcie 4.0 graphics cards are able to make full use of it. But I also heard that the x570 boards might be struggling with pcie 4.0? I can't tell if that's rumor or a known issue since it's early tech and SSDs are the only things we can currently benefit from.

I also want to be able to use DDR5 when it comes out, despite the early-adopter tax. Buying new ram sticks as they get better will be easier than having to get a new motherboard/cpu to even support them. I just have no idea when that will be available and information seems scarce and very speculative from my searching.

If I get a Zen 2 chip now, will a x670 board be able to use it? Will a 3950x be compatible with ddr5? Has there even been an announcement that the x670 boards will use ddr5? I won't mind upgrading the cpu or motherboard to hit the next milestone, but I certainly don't want to have to do both if it is going to be a complete road block to future upgrades.",Trying to decide whether it's worth it to upgrade to a 3950x now or wait for AM5.

Amd,"I am planning to buy a new PC because I want to try AMD after being an Intel user since forever, and I set my heart on the upcoming Ryzen 4000. Since I'm not in a hurry (it's not a problem to wait 1 or 2 years, my actual PC is not very old nor slow for my needs) I've been suggested to wait for the upcoming AM5 socket since it will support several new technologies (DDR5 RAM, 5nm cpu, etc.), and so I will have room to upgrade in the future, whereas if I buy the latest generation of the AM4 I will need to buy new motherboard and RAM if I want to upgrade the CPU to a newer gen. one (I already need to buy everything new, DDR4 RAM included).

After this someone else suggested to avoid new sockets because the first cpu generations are always buggy. I checked around and I found it to be true with Ryzen (e.g. many people reported stability issues within the Linux environment with Ryzen 1000 and even 2000, which were fixed in the 3000 series).

I never considered such things before, I always bought what I liked or needed at that moment. I like the idea of having room to upgrade without buying everything once more (if I buy Ryzen 4000 I will certainly have to wait at least until AM6 or whatever to upgrade, whereas a new CPU only will be a doable purchase), but I also cannot afford silent data corruption or things like that. I don't care if the PC is not the fastest, but I care that it is stable.

So is it really a choice of upgradability of a new socket vs ""maturity"" of an old one (maturity as in having the issues of the first cpu generation(s) fixed)?

Right now I'm on a 2700X and X370 ATX mobo, ghetto open air on my desk. I plan to switch to ITX and get an SFF case for my future build. I haven't kept up with the news but have read Ryzen 4000 is still on track for late 2020 and a socket change is coming after. 

My plan is to buy a 3900X and X570 ITX to last me 6+ years, but my concern is I won't be able to use the same mobo in 3 years' time for a halftime upgrade (I'm supposing 20 cores will be mainstream $500ish by then). The other idea is to wait and get a 4900X or whatever, with an X570 mobo, but just how big of a leap will the 4000 series be?

Amd,"**EDIT**: Seemed to be slightly improved by adding 50mV to CPU vCore. Thanks to this [thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/d2wwp9/psa_crucial_ballistix_ram_unstable_on_zen2_on/) Getting less errors, but still occuring unfortunately.

Anyone who has been around this subreddit long enough knows that the supposed ""sweet spot"" for RAM speeds on Zen 2 Ryzen 3000 series is DDR4-3600, but not every processor is actually capable of running stable at that speed.

Anyway below are my specs.

&gt;Ryzen 5 3600  
&gt;  
&gt;AsRock B450 Steel Legend at BIOS 3.20 (why not 3.40? See below.)  
&gt;  
&gt;2x8GB Ballistix DDR4-3600 Micron Rev. E (a.k.a the fabled ""e die"")  
&gt;  
&gt;Gigabyte GTX 1060  
&gt;  
&gt;Intel 660P 2TB + Crucial MX500 500GB  
&gt;  
&gt;Windows 10 2004

I can set the XMP profile in BIOS and Windows starts up just fine. I can game for weeks, run Prime 95 large FFT for hours with no crashes. Everything seems fine at first glance, so you think it's all stable right?

Wrong.

Go into Event Viewer and you will see multiple WHEA 19 correctable errors like this one every time you boot up Windows or wake it up from sleep.

`A corrected hardware error has occurred.`

&amp;#x200B;

`Reported by component: Processor Core`

`Error Source: Unknown Error Source`

`Error Type: Bus/Interconnect Error`

`Processor APIC ID: 0`

&amp;#x200B;

`The details view of this entry contains further information.`

Every once in a while my SSD disappears, or my PC gets a black screen and reboots by itself. I have every reason to believe that it is related to the RAM speeds issue.

Dropping speeds down to DDR4-3200 prevents the WHEA errors from popping up. And AsRock's BIOS 3.40 completely kills the stability and prevents me from booting up with XMP anyway, so there's that.

Running XMP at memory speeds [higher than 3200MHz is considered overclocking for Zen 2 processors](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3950x), and quite frankly you should not be [overly worried about any potential loss in performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/c97hq4/3200mhz_vs_3600mhz_on_ryzen_3000_series/esvgh9w/), at least according to u/AMD_Robert.

I suppose those who bought 5700/XTs might also want to lower their memory speeds and loosen up timings a bit to gain more stability.

With all that being said, if your CPU cannot even reach DDR4-3200, you might want to RMA that thing.

EDIT: Added settings below. First pic shows the default BIOS settings from the motherboard. Lowering VDDCR SOC, CLD0\_VDDP and CLD0\_VDDG voltages didn't fix anything.

Amd,"I recently bought a R7 3700X from Newegg as it was on sale and came with the new AC. (I have mixed feelings on the current AC games, but I would have eventually picked it up) 

I also upgraded my mobo to an x570, because I was using a cheap B450 and wanted a nice, bigger mobo with PCIE 4.0 support, and found one on sale. 

The CPU had the option to be bought with the mobo I wanted, so they could be shipped together, but unfortunately when choosing this it eliminates the AC game as it is apparently put as a different item in their system. 

I called customer support, and got someone who couldn’t understand me, with loud arguments and talking in the background. I tried explaining things to her, and it sounded like she understood but when I hung up I saw that she somehow misunderstood me and filed a claim saying I never got my CPU in the mail.

I then used the live chat to explain the situation and got someone who was very nice and added the game to my account for free. She told me to allow up to 24 for the code to be processed and emailed to me. 

I waited 5 days and got no code, so I contacted live chat again. I was told that it’s taking long because it was manually added to my account, so wait 2 more days.

It has now been 2 weeks and I have still gotten nothing. The order is on my account and has said “in processing” since it has been added.

I’m sick of dealing with Newegg and I’m loving my new CPU, but I did buy it expecting a game code with it, and the customer support was frustrating. I feel like it will never come and I’ll just be told to get over it.

- use two graphics cards, one with 16 PCIe Lanes and one with 8 (or two with both 8 lanes)

I have limited knowledge of PCs and I’m looking to build a budget PC with room to upgrade. 

The story:
I bought a refurbished Dell a very very long time ago (2008?) and around this time last year decided to upgrade so a buddy of mine helped me open the Dell up and found a lot of it was welded to the case so I bought a new mobo, cpu cooler and PSU and planned to reuse the CPU, RAM and HDD, along with a SSD another friend gave me. I bought a case and all the parts arrived but I get no display. I figured seeing as all the parts were ancient I could just re use the HDD, SSD and Case and build an AMD system and I’ve been umming and arring ever since. My problem is funds as I want a working pc but don’t particularly want to spend over £300, lower if I can help it.

I need a CPU, PSU, MOBO and RAM to which I will add to the parts listed above. GPU would be something I’d like to add in the future but for the time being I’d like to be able to run say League of Legends without so I guess onboard graphics are needed.

 What if to combat Nvidia's likely addition of raytracing co-processors (speculated in Coretek's video, and indirectly pictured in leaks), AMD allows a second RDNA2 card to assist in RT workloads. 

The Xbox series X hotchips presentation showed us that the RDNA2 CU's can do either standard geometry OR raytracing calculations. If we're assuming that 64-80 CU's are coming at the top end how many are gonna be sacrificed for RT performance? Xbox series x's 52CUs is calculated to be around 2080 perf. Whether thats with our without raytracing is unconfirmed obviously. Wouldn't it be super easy ( for consumers)  to buy a 20 CU card just for added raytracing performance. Of course crossfire as we know it is dead, but maybe AMD's close work on the new DXR suite has brought it back in some form for this. Just want to hear thoughts from people smarter than me.

Amd,"I wanted to compare my current cpu (Intel i7-6700HQ on Asus 551V) versus my next laptop (AMD 4800H on XMG Core 15). Of course in the conclusion about the 4800H, we've got this nugget:

Amd,"Hi,

I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm new to Reddit.

I use my PC to play COD &amp; Destiny 2. I have a Ryzen 5 3600. I read somewhere that these games don't use all cores so the way to improve gaming performance is to run the CPU at a higher clock. I don't have any prior experience with overclocking. I downloaded Ryzen Master and updated Profile 2 with 1.325v and started pushing up the core frequency. After each run I ran CB15 a few times to see if the system remained stable. I stopped at 4525 since I wasn't expecting it to get this high without a crash but Windows never crashed. I'm wondering if I should keep increasing (while leaving the voltage at 1.325).

You can see the results in the attached pictures. I watched youtube video below but the speaker (who talks like an expert) wasn't able to get his CPU to clock beyond 4200 and in the process he made a lot of changes in his BIOS while I just set the RM voltage to 1.325 and am using stock x570 tomahawk bios with only XMP enabled.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oV69bYQq4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oV69bYQq4)

Wondering if I got lucky with an over clockable Ryzen 5 or if I'm just missing something?

I'm an advanced computer/windows/linux user but I haven't overclocked a CPU before and there seems to be a lot of terminology etc. I'm just OC'ing for fun to learn more about how CPUs work.

My idle CPU temp is 32C and it went as high as 68C during the CB15 runs. Its  connected to a 360mm AIO (I got a large AIO so I could keep the fans at low rpm).

Any feedback on next steps?

Thanks in advance.

Amd,"Hello everyone,

I am using Ryzen 7 2700x with Asus X470-F gaming motherboard. I am not sure why my EDC(CPU) is constantly very high at idle, and the CPU peak speed is constantly 4Ghz+, even at idle.

https://preview.redd.it/6iyb7cfanpi51.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9934b87f03e7f658b90ea920d164590b64c956b

I googled and followed the common fix by turning on Windows Balanced power plan and minimum processor state is set at 5%, but the EDC is still very high.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the root issue here?

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Updates\]**

I just realized that the PBO was set to Disabled in ASUS BIOS. I enabled it now and the results are better.

At idle, Temperature ranges from 45C to 55C, EDC ranges from 88% to 95%. CPU voltage ranges from 1.4V to 1.55V. CPU peak speed is still constantly very high at idle, 4.1GHz++.

Are these results considered normal? I think my desktop has good cooling with Lian Li PC-011 casing, 9x LL120 corsair fans and with Grizzly Conductonaut Liquid Metal thermal paste.

Amd,"Hello! I've been experimenting with reducing the heat output and noise of my 5700XT, and have come to some interesting findings.


MY SPECS (all stock settings, but XMP engaged):

GPU: Sapphire Pulse 5700XT
MOBO: Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus
CPU: Ryzen 3700X
CPU cooler: Noctua NH-U12A
RAM: G.Skill TridentZ F4-3600C15D-16GTZ
SSD: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1TB
PSU: Corsair AX850
CASE: Fractal Define R6 with 2x140mm intake and 1x140mm exhaust


METHODOLOGY:

- Used a clean install (DDU) of v20.8.2. drivers, left everything at default
- Also never touched wattman within the drivers, used MorePowerTool instead.
- Used the silent bios of my card (has dual bios switch) which conforms to a cap of 180W (GPU die only) power draw.
- Inside MorePowerTool, only modified the  ""GFX maximum (MHz)"" setting under the ""frequency"" tab, everything else was left unaltered from the original bios settings. The default maximum for that setting is 2100 MHz for the Sapphire Pulse 5700XT with the ""silent bios"" engaged.
- Used two benchmark runs at the highest graphics preset at my native resolution of 2560x1080 for Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Gears 5, Wolfenstein Youngblood and Unigine Valley.
- Noted down only average fps values (didn't bother with min% this time - besides everyone by now knows that Navi stutters so min% is not too good either way).
- Monitored everything with GPU-Z.
- In the end calculated the fps average of all benchmark runs (Wolfenstein has two benchmarks, so that's why it's devided by 5).


RESULTS:

(A) At stock, where the GPU core frequency violently fluctuates from 1700 to 2050 Mhz and the voltage from about 950 to 1200 mV on average, the card never exceeded 180W of GPU-only power draw, and the highest GPU hotspot temperature reading was 88C. Results:

SOTR: 99 fps
Gears5: 87 fps
WolfY bench1: 143 fps
Wolfy bench2: 168 fps
Valley: 90 fps

Average: 117 fps (100% of stock performance, 100% of stock power draw, 100% of stock heat)


(B) Modifying the ""GFX maximum (MHz)"" setting to 1740, the GPU core frequency hovered between 1695 and 1705 MHz under 100% load, the voltage fluctuated between 962 and 968 mV, the GPU-only power draw never exceeded 155W and the highest GPU hotspot temperature reading was 80C. Results:

SOTR: 95 fps
Gears5: 82 fps
WolfY bench1: 137 fps
Wolfy bench2: 160 fps
Valley 87 fps

Average: 112 fps (96% of stock performance, 86% of stock power draw, 91% of stock heat)


(C) Finally, modifying the ""GFX maximum (MHz)"" setting to 1640, the GPU core frequency hovered between 1595 and 1605 MHz under 100% load, the voltage always stayed at exactly 906 mV, the GPU-only power draw never exceeded 135W and the highest GPU hotspot temperature reading was 76C. Results:

SOTR: 91
Gears5: 79
WolfY bench1: 132
WolfY bench2: 153
Valley: 84

Average: 108 fps (92% of stock performance, 75% of stock power draw, 86% of stock heat)


OBSERVATIONS and CONCLUSION:

Although I haven't even touched any other setting except the max GPU frequency inside MorePowerTool, the GPU seemed to follow the default voltage curve nicely, and was simply capped at the exact voltage that the max entered frequency would need. This is actually different behaviour than the default numerical value of 2100 MHz gpu max frequency exhibits (violently fluctuating frequency, with very big amplitudes of 1700 to 2050 MHz under 100% load), and is only observed if that number is entered. In the end, a rock stable 1600 MHz core clock with almost no fluctuations at only 906 mV (also fixed value, no fluctuations) is quite the stark difference and thus quite fascinating to me.

In the end it seems like AMD has again been forced to push it's GPU past it's optimal efficiency point. As can be seen from the above, one can manually downclock the GPU to save 25% on energy consumption at only 8% the performance cost compared to stock settings. I've been running the 1600MHz setting for over a month now and it's 100% stable, cool and quiet, and I haven't percieved any noticable performance deficit. That last statement is obviously subjective, so YMMV.

I'd like to hear if anyone has tried something similar. Share your results please!

P.S. I know 2560x1080 isn't exactly a common resolution, but it's my monitors (ultrawide) native resolution.

Amd," 

I tried an 4.2 Ghz OC with 1.296 Volt.

Full disclosure: It wasnt stable enough to run prime 95 for over 10 minutes - however i was able to play 2 games of Apex Legends with no problems at all. - Stable enough for me i am only every gaming or watching videos on my pc anyways

First question:

I've noticed a few things that show differently in HW info when (OC) or in (stock)  
so first of all, what is Core VID and why does it sit at 1.1V when (OC)'d ?  
I've see it go up to 1,475V in (stock) before... [https://imgur.com/a/mBBRNrx](https://imgur.com/a/mBBRNrx)

Second question

How long will my CPU life with the 1.296V clocked at 4.2Ghz compared to when i leave it at stock?  
I know it's hard to tell but would this OC generally shorten the cpu's lifespan, make it longer or dont influence it at all?

Third question

(OC) clocks are at 4.191Ghz vs (stock) 4.049Ghz

(OC)Voltage is generally lower i think vs (stock) Voltage

all core 4.2ghz (oc) gives me better benchmark scores.

check the pictures please for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/nT5GJyE](https://imgur.com/a/nT5GJyE)

The question is, is it worth it? Am i getting any benefits from doing specifically this OC?

What are the benefits exactly ?

Fourth Question

I was under the assumption that my CPU is pretty bad, it never goes over 4.049Ghz effective clock speed. CPU-Z Validator also gave me that score. It checks out with HWinfo.

The highest score i got from CPU-Z is 4091Mhz [https://imgur.com/a/Ogpg70x](https://imgur.com/a/Ogpg70x)  
The reason why i think this is bad is because it is nowhere close to the 4.4Ghz that are advertized on the box.

Based on the image and the previous 12 pin power connector, it looks like the new 3090 is a huge power consuming card that was created by Nvidia to be able to hold on their crown against the RDNA 2.

If AMD will be able to bring a card that is equal or better than the 2080 Ti at 450-600 USD, we will see a gpu Ryzen phenomena.

Now I remember the disastrous ""Poor Volta"" times but I hope this time AMD will pull it off because I doubt they will get another chance on the 5nm process from Nvidia.

# *Please read the notes below, including when and when not to update your UEFI.

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – 40 total release –**

Motherboards and the corresponding chipsets with updates are noted below - I have revised the title and moving forward will note the chipsets included in the title post for clarity - For reference, the W33 is in relation to the workweek.

These updates were released during the week of the 16th ( This month in August )

***What is my motherboard is not listed?***

If you are looking for your motherboard/model I would suggest going to [https://www.asus.com/us/support/](https://www.asus.com/us/support/) and checking if it has been updated recently. I post updates on a weekly basis. Many times UEFI’s are releases in waves, this can mean it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are for all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about releases?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news [https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY)

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year and a half boards tend to reach a certain maturity level and see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release please submit a support ticket. In some cases some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

&amp;#x200B;

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below. It will guide you through the flashing process as well as provide insight into important items to keep in mind when flashing/updating the UEFI BIOS.

**How to Flash / Update your UEFI BIOS on ASUS Motherboards -**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

# While this is covered in the video please keep in mind not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again if you are running without issues you are advised to stay on the release you are running.

**Notes to consider -**

&amp;#x200B;

1. I  recommend UEFI updates for new builds to help ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC      and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.
2. Users who have a system running without issue are recommended that they stay on that build. There are many subtle changes that can be phased in between builds and change operating parameters. Changes to items like memory training and other auto rules can affect your system's operating experience especially if you are running overclocked configurations (this includes CPU overclocking, DRAM overclocking, or overclocking of both).      This is true regardless of the fact regression testing is done to ensure a      generally positive transition experience when comparing an older release to a newer release. In most situations, the vast majority of users who are running stock will experience a seamless transition once the update is complete.
3. Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash I would recommend load UEFI      defaults and completing a full reboot prior to redefining prior values.
4. **Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible.** This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode ( such as an AMD AEGSA      or Intel ME ).
5. **While not always necessary so upgrades may require a clearing of the CMOS to reset the UEFI and ensure normal functionality.** You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard supports it or by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS  jumper on the motherboard and short the pins to clear the CMOS.
6. I  would also note some users running legacy SATA based SSDs may experience issues with initialization of their drives. Please consider checking whether there is updated firmware for your SSD which may improve interoperability and compatibility and possible bugs in power states and initialization. It is also important to note that some legacy SSD/storage controllers do not offer optimal compatibility in regards to power cycling. Users that are running complex storage configurations including   RAID should be cautious as updates to the PCH or FCH firmware or option ROM can corrupt RAID volumes and render them non-bootable.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

The board model/name is on the right-hand side and the version number is on the left-hand side. To download the UEFI BIOS please go to [support.asus.com](https://support.asus.com/) or you use the integrated EZFlash3 download function if your motherboard supports it, this will allow for direct downloading/updating of the UEFI BIOS as along as an Ethernet connection with an active internet connection is present.

Based upon the performance of these Renoir processors in the mobile space, there is substantial interest in these Renoir processors for desktop systems compared to not only Intel’s Core desktop Comet Lake processors due to their high performance, lower power consumption, and highly capable integrated graphics but also to the Ryzen 3000 series “Matisse” chiplet based desktop processors. The chips in the desktop Renoir Ryzen 4000 Pro/4000G series are identical in design and layout compared to the mobile Renoir Ryzen 4000 series but binned for different power requirements of 35 W and 65 W (GE and G series respectively) compared to the mobile Ryzen 4000 series of 18 W and 45 W (U and H series respectively). Since all of these mobile and desktop Renoir chips, as well as AMD’s current Matisse desktop chips, are fabricated on the same 7 nm process at TSMC, analysis of the performance of these processors will yield some information regarding not only the performance efficiency of the TSMC process, but also information of how the integrated monolithic Renoir architecture compares to the chiplet design that has gained AMD such traction in the consumer enthusiast space over the last 3 years.

The information regarding the performance on the mobile Renoir Ryzen 4000 series processors in both Lenovo and Asus notebooks was gathered from various review sites across the web. In particular, let’s examine the sustained performance of the 8c/16t processors so as to be able to compare the performance of the same processor as a function of power, and hence frequency binning. Why sustained performance? Well that will show two things: 1) the balance between the heat generated by the CPU compared to the cooling system employed which then sets the processor frequency due to temperature and 2) the performance you could actually expect for a similarly well cooled processor in a desktop system that is operating within its rated power envelope with a CPU temperature in the 80 C +/- 10 C range. The binned power, AMD processor marketing name, corresponding notebooks, and estimated sustained CPU speeds during the Cinebench 15 loop (15 runs) are as follows:

For the Lenovo laptops, only the Ryzen 4750U in the Thinkpad T14s [exhibited no drop in performance](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T14s-AMD-Ryzen-7-Pro-4750U-leaves-Intel-in-the-dust.481489.0.html) with sustained load while the Ryzen 4800H in the Legion 5 exhibited a drop in performance of less than 100 CB 15 points (4.3%). For the Asus laptops, the Ryzen 4800HS in both the G14 and G15 laptops exhibited a drop in performance of less than 100 points (6.6% and 4.3% respectively) while the Ryzen 9 4900HS in the same G14 chassis exhibited a drop of almost 200 points (10.9%) while all were in their ‘standard’ (i.e., non-turbo) performance modes and fan curves. Although the Ryzen 4900HS exhibited the largest drop in performance with sustained loads, this 35W processor still narrowly outperforms the 35W Ryzen 4800HS in the same chassis thus giving credence the slightly better binning of this processor. Due to the rather steady performance of these processors with thermal loading, the cooling systems employed in these laptops appear to be well matched for the thermal loads generated by the mobile Ryzen 4000 series processors. The figure below shows the sustained Cinebench 15 performance of these 8 core/16 thread Renoir Ryzen 4000 series chips in these various notebooks compared to their CPU power consumption.

[Sustained CB15 performance of Renoir mobile as function of CPU power](https://i.redd.it/w2hcftxdkgi51.gif)

The performance as a function of CPU power shows there is a fairly linear increase of performance with increasing CPU power and hence CPU frequency for CPU power consumption less than 45-50 W. Past this power or frequency, there appears to be a rapid increase in power consumption with diminishing performance gains. In particular, the 4800H in in the Lenovo Legion in Balanced mode consumes 49 W of power with a sustained processor speed of about 3.75 GHz and temperature of 79 C for a score between 1850-1890 CB 15 points. In Performance mode, the 4800H consumes 69 W of power for a CPU frequency and temperature of about 4.1 GHz and 90 C for 1980 points. Thus a 40% increase in power yields less than a 10% increase in sustained clock speed and only about a 5% increase in performance.","Comparison of 8c/16t Renoir mobile performance as function of power (U, HS, and H)",clear last sever month creat high perform system renoir ryzen mobil seri compar intel u w h w seri notebook processor base upon numer review across web renoir ryzen mobil seri outperform th gener comet lake ice lake processor x depend notebook seri u seri match intel h seri notebookcheck net lenovo thinkpad ryzen pro u leav intel dust html h seri perform similarli intel w desktop processor recent renoir ryzen also announc desktop via oem ryzen pro tomshardwar news ryzen review show strong graphic perform seri rumor releas date enthusiast consum space later base upon perform renoir processor mobil space substanti interest renoir processor desktop system compar intel core desktop comet lake processor due high perform lower power consumpt highli capabl integr graphic also ryzen seri matiss chiplet base desktop processor chip desktop renoir ryzen pro g seri ident design layout compar mobil renoir ryzen seri bin differ power requir w w ge g seri respect compar mobil ryzen seri w w u h seri respect sinc mobil desktop renoir chip well current matiss desktop chip fabric nm process tsmc analysi perform processor yield inform regard perform effici tsmc process also inform integr monolith renoir architectur compar chiplet design gain traction consum enthusiast space last year inform regard perform mobil renoir ryzen seri processor lenovo asu notebook gather variou review site across web particular let examin sustain perform c processor abl compar perform processor function power henc frequenc bin sustain perform well show two thing balanc heat gener compar cool system employ set processor frequenc due temperatur perform could actual expect similarli well cool processor desktop system oper within rate power envelop temperatur c c rang bin power processor market name correspond notebook estim sustain speed cinebench loop run follow w ryzen u lenovo thinkpad reddit r thinkpad comment hyapij impress vs x carbon gen intel ghz w ryzen hs asu rog zephyru g ga iv ultrabookreview asu rog zephyru g ga iv review ghz w ryzen hs asu roc zephyru g ga iu ultrabookreview asu rog zephyru g review ghz w ryzen hs asu roc zephyru g ga iv ultrabookreview asu zephryu g ryzen hs ghz w ryzen h lenovo legion ultrabookreview lenovo legion review ghz w ryzen h lenovo legion ultrabookreview lenovo legion review ghz lenovo laptop ryzen u thinkpad exhibit drop perform notebookcheck net lenovo thinkpad ryzen pro u leav intel dust html sustain load ryzen h legion exhibit drop perform less cb point asu laptop ryzen hs g g laptop exhibit drop perform less point respect ryzen hs g chassi exhibit drop almost point standard e non turbo perform mode fan curv although ryzen hs exhibit largest drop perform sustain load w processor still narrowli outperform w ryzen hs chassi thu give credenc slightli better bin processor due rather steadi perform processor thermal load cool system employ laptop appear well match thermal load gener mobil ryzen seri processor figur show sustain cinebench perform core thread renoir ryzen seri chip variou notebook compar power consumpt sustain cb perform renoir mobil function power redd w hcftxdkgi gif perform function power show fairli linear increas perform increas power henc frequenc power consumpt less w past power frequenc appear rapid increas power consumpt diminish perform gain particular h lenovo legion balanc mode consum w power sustain processor speed ghz temperatur c score cb point perform mode h consum w power frequenc temperatur ghz c point thu increas power yield less increas sustain clock speed increas perform comparison c renoir mobil perform function power u hs h

Amd,"  In this post, I am going to compare the 8c/16t mobile Renoir performance to an equivalent Renoir desktop as well as correlate the CPU power consumption to the average/sustained all core boost frequency. The implications are there appears to be a rapid non-linearity in power consumption for marginal increments in frequency above about 4 GHz

Comparing the mobile 4800H to the desktop 4750G shows roughly similar performance in CB15 with the mobile 4800H at 69 W scoring 1980 points and the 65 W desktop equivalent Renoir Ryzen 7 Pro 4750G [scoring 2086 points](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-4000-review-shows-strong-cpu-and-graphics-performance). This is roughly a 5.1% increase in performance for the desktop compared to the 4800H in Performance mode. But this is not a direct apples-to-apples comparison because the Cinebech 15 score for the Ryzen 7 Pro 4750G was for an open air tested bed with DDR4-3600CL18 memory and not the DDR4-3200 speed memory AMD seems to be limiting laptops to. Further, typical DDR4-3200 1.2 V (non-XMP profile) laptop memory has a CL of at least 22. [Based upon memory frequency and CL scaling for low latency memory in a Ryzen 3700X desktop system](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/patriot_viper_steel_ddr4_3600_mhz_64_gb_2x32gb,11.html), there is about a 0.8% increase in performance in Cinebench 20 scores in going from DDR4-3200CL16 to DDR4-3600CL18. So the effect of going from DDR4-3600CL18 to DDR4-3200CL22 should be about a decrease of about 3% in performance. The remaining difference in scores could be attributed to the open air test bed and non-repeated runs which could lead to an extra 50-100 MHz of boost clock for the 4750G compared to the 4800H. But overall, the same processor consuming the same power yields the same performance whether in a well cooled notebook or a desktop system. Further, the 4800H at 45W with lower memory bandwidth and worse memory timings has about 90% of the performance of the desktop 65W 4750G at stock settings. 

As mentioned earlier, these desktop Renoir processors are going to be available in retail alongside AMD’s current Matisse Ryzen 3000 series processors. So let’s compare the performance of an 8c/16t monolithic Renoir chip to a chiplet based Matisse Ryzen 3700X since both processors utilize the Zen 2 cores, are rated for 65 W, and have base clocks of 3.6 GHz and max boost clocks of 4.4 GHz, and both processors have 2 CCX’s of 4 cores each. Besides the monolithic versus chiplet, the only other difference between these two processor is the size of the L3 cache with the Renoir Ryzen Pro 4750G having 8 MB of L3 cache while the Matisse based Ryzen 3700X has a much larger 16 MB of L3 cache. The effect of these two different architectures turns out to be about the same in Cinebench 15 performance with the Renoir Ryzen 7 Pro 4750G [scoring 2086 points](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-4000-review-shows-strong-cpu-and-graphics-performance) with DDR4-3600CL18 RAM and [2168 points at 4.44 GHz with unknown RAM](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-4700g-flagship-renoir-8-core-desktop-apu-benchmarked-matches-95w-ryzen-7-3800x/) while the Matisse Ryzen 3700X [scores 2086 points with DDR4-3200CL16](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14605/the-and-ryzen-3700x-3900x-review-raising-the-bar/9) and [2101 points with DDR4-3600CL16](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_7_3700x_ryzen_9_3900x_review,9.html). Thus despite the lower quantity of L3 cache in the Renoir chips, the Renoir and Matisse chips are performing about the same. But it is not only in Cinebench, the WPrime 1024M scores appear to be within a few percent of each other also with [90.9 s for 4800H and 88.2 s for 4900HS](https://www.notebookcheck.net/R7-4800H-vs-R9-4900HS_11677_11882.247596.0.html) compared to [86 s for a 3700X](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_7_3700x_ryzen_9_3900x_review,19.html) despite faster RAM and larger caches for the 3700X. In these applications, the overall performance seems to be rather independent of L3 cache architecture trade-offs with Renoir performing about the same as desktop Matisse.

Entangled within these CPU architecture comparisons is the fact that both architectures are fabricated on the same TSMC 7 nm node. For these Zen 2 architectures, there appears to be a large performance wall for processor speeds in excess of 3.8 GHz (about 45 W) as there is rapidly decreasing performance with ‘large increases’ in power consumption past this frequency. For both the Matisse and Renoir architectures, the CB 15 scores as a function of CPU power and the CPU power as a function of average or sustained processor speed are shown in the figures below.

&amp;#x200B;

These plots suggest that the 65 W chips are fabricated at the edge of the performance of the process node. This edge is clear when one considers the power consumption of the Ryzen 3800X is 62% higher compared to the 3700X for a less than 10% increase in base frequency (3.6 GHz to 3.9 GHz) and a maximum turbo boost gain of about 2% (4.4 GHz to 4.5 GHz). Along these lines, overclocking attempts on the 65 W Ryzen 3700X will almost double power consumption in going from their ‘normal’ [all core boost of ‘4.0-4.1 GHz’](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_7_3700x_ryzen_9_3900x_review,7.html) to [up to 4.4 GHz](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_7_3700x_ryzen_9_3900x_review,27.html) with a corresponding increase in performance  of 5-10%. This is not just true for the 3700X, but all of the Matisse Ryzen 3000 series desktop processors seem to follow this trend of average processor frequencies of [about 3.9-4.0 GHz for the 3950X](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-review,7.html) up to [4.2 GHz for the 3300X](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3581-amd-ryzen-3-3300x-cpu-review-vs-3100-clock-for-clock) and [not their temporary boost frequencies](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-review/2) of 4.4-4.6 GHz. Conversely, as evidence by the ‘Eco’ mode on 3000 series Threadrippers, there can be substantial [35.7% reduction in power consumption](https://www.computerbase.de/2019-12/threadripper-3000-180-watt-tdp-test/#diagramm-test-performancerating-fuer-anwendungen-multi-core) for only modest 10% decrease in performance. 

Mathematically speaking, analysis of the CPU power-frequency plot suggests that it is actually detrimental to ‘boost’ above the 65 W all core frequency of 4 GHz. As a first pass analysis, let’s assume a task takes 2 seconds with all 8 cores running at 4.0 GHz and the processor package is consuming 65 W for a total of 130 J of energy consumed. Now let’s assume the processor can boost all cores to 4.4 GHz and consumes 100 W while doing so. It could finish the task in 1.8 s assuming 100% linearity in performance with frequency but would then have averaged 90 W of power over the 2 seconds and consumed 180 J of energy assuming an unrealistic consumption of 0 W for 0.2 s. This is almost 40% more power and energy than the average. In order to maintain the same average power consumption of 65 W or 130 J over the 2 seconds, this means that the processor must drop down to lower frequencies and power for a period of time in order to maintain the average. This means that energy consumed in the boost state plus the energy consumed in a lower power state must equal 130 J over 2 seconds or mathematically this becomes 100 W\*x seconds + 42 W\*(2-x seconds) = 130 J assuming the processor goes between the minimum processor frequency (3.6 GHz, 42 W) and the maximum boost (4.4 GHz, 100 W) as shown at Tom’s Hardware. For these 2 processor states, x=0.7031 seconds (boost time) with an average processor frequency of 3.88 GHz over these 2 seconds. Thus the processor must drop down for longer periods of time to maintain an average heat output of 65 W due to the larger power consumption per MHz above 4 GHz compared to below 4 GHz. Assuming the uncore consumes 10 W of power yields the same time breakout. Thus it seems slower than steady state.

What can be expected for Zen 3 Vermeer in Q4 of this year still fabricated on the 7 nm node? Well, the effect of a doubling the L3 cache from 16 MB to 32 MB in going from the Ryzen 2000 series to the Ryzen 3000 series was attributed to being a significant reason for the 15-17% IPC between the generations. With the prediction that each 8c/16t compute cluster will share and have direct access to 32 MB of L3 cache in Zen 3 Vermeer, it seems reasonable that early reports of the performance of Zen 3 Vermeer is to have another 17-20% IPC compared to Matisse. However, there does not seem to be evidence for large increases in processor frequency compared to Matisse as evidenced by the recent information regarding [the upcoming 16/32 thread Vermeer equivalent](https://www.igorslab.de/exklusive-informationen-zu-amds-naechter-cpu-generation-ryzen-9-4950x-vermeer-mit-hohem-boost-takt-und-neuen-features-a-la-intel/) of the Matisse 3950X. As a result, the performance gains of Vermeer should be directly tied to CPU architecture changes and not frequency.

The performance data shows the L3 cache deficient monolithic Renoir architecture performs about the same as the Matisse chiplet architecture with similar power draws and processor frequencies. However, the [preliminary overclocking performance](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-4700g-8-core-renoir-apu-4-55-ghz-overclock-benchmarks-leak/) of the desktop Renoir chips may be substantially better than Matisse and even better when [water cooling the CPU into an ice bath](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-4700g-renoir-flagship-8-core-apu-5-ghz-ddr4-5400-overclock/). These extreme efforts can yield 15-20% frequency improvements compared to about 10% for Matisse. What is more interesting for the Renoir architecture is the apparent increase in Infinity Fabric speed from roughly 1600 MHz to 2200 MHz which allows a substantial increase in memory bandwidth from 51.2 GB/s (DDR4-3200 with 1:1 Infinity Fabric ratio) to in excess of 70.4 GB/s ([DDR4-4400 with 1:1 Infinity fabric ratio](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-4700g-8-core-renoir-desktop-apu-4-8-ghz-overclock-ddr4-4400-if-2200-mhz-achieved/)). This may have a material impact on the performance of the Renoir desktop processors since the performance of Ryzen processors increases as memory bandwidth increases. So how does AMD not shoot themselves in the foot and drive the massive uptake of these Renoir chips in place of the current Matisse and upcoming Zen 3 Ryzen 4000 Vermeer desktop chips? For Matisse, continued price cuts will help. As for Vermeer, it is pure speculation, but most likely, there will be a performance leak regarding Vermeer and its 20ish percent increase in performance relative to these Matisse and Renoir processors so as to keep the enthusiasm of Vermeer afloat regardless of the potential lower Infinity fabric speeds and memory bandwidth compared to Renoir desktop systems. That would also explain the staggered launch of probably locked OEM versions of Renoir chips relative to the enthusiast market launch. Or maybe, AMD is feeling the effect of a lack of non-gaming desktop systems in the very large OEM channel.  Regardless, the cadence of ‘new for enthusiast desktop and server market’ will probably always be the leading edge so the enthusiast desktop market will always lead the mobile market. 

With the increased resistances in materials with decreasing dimensions, power will continue to be a problem above certain frequencies for each ‘node.’ Perhaps it is time to forget about naming nodes based upon optical scaling laws that have since long not matched actual transistor sizes for years. But have nodes based upon the year they went into mass production. For example, TSMC’s 7nm, which went into mass production for Apple and Qualcomm in 2018, could be named as 2018LP and the higher power variant for AMD as 2018HP. After all, [TSMC has already issued guidance](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/289157-tsmc-completes-5nm-node-design-node-in-risk-production) that 5 nm will have only a 15% performance improvement at the same power or up to 20% power savings at the same frequency compared to 7 nm despite a 45% area reduction in feature size with about half of these values being realizable in going from 7 nm to 7+ nm. This disjoint between transistor size reduction versus power savings or increase in frequency suggests it will be a struggle for silicon processors to achieve large increases in sustained processor speeds at ‘reasonable’ power consumption as sustained frequencies creep past 4 GHz toward 5 GHz. It also suggests there will be a power wall of rapidly increasing power consumption past a critical frequency for these manufacturing processes as evidenced by AMD at 7 nm and Intel at 14 nm. For the current Zen 2 core architecture on the TSMC 7 nm process, AMD’s current 8c/16t monolithic Renoir and Matisse processors have very similar performance while operating at similar frequencies, power consumption, and memory timings despite different L3 cache sizes. It should also be noted monolithic 45 W chip can perform within 10% of either the current chiplet or monolithic based 65 W desktop CPUs due to the rather steep power/frequency wall above a CPU power of 50 W or 3.8 GHz. Further, both processors seem to be near the inflection point of the TSMC 7 nm process regarding power consumptions and TSMC has already indicated to not expect large increases in sustained processor frequencies for the upcoming 7+ nm or 5 nm nodes. Hence AMD’s choice of more cores from 7 years ago but everyday 5 GHz at low power consumption does not look promising.",Comparison of 8c/16t mobile Renoir to desktop Renoir and Matisse - TSMC 7 nm wall?

Amd,"My computer currently runs an i5-9400f, and I found that it wasn't really able to keep up with some heavier multitasking. I was going to wait for the 4000 series and black friday, but the 3900X went on a hefty discount so I snapped it up with an asus X570-F, and I know it absolutely demolishes one of the scenarios I want that the intel can't handle. 

Problem is this is my first time upgrading a computer and I have no clue what to expect once I've put it together and I don't want to screw it up.

I currently run Windows 10 off an SSD. Assuming I physically put everything together correctly, would I just be able to continue on as if nothing changed (sans a likely win10 deactivation because mobo, that's whatever, I can reactivate)? Or would I need to go through some mandatory bios stuff or driver stuff?

Would it be best to reinstall windows using a piece of install media? If not, would I need to install Amd x570 drivers to my windows 10 in order for the new cpu to work beforehand, or do they install automatically from the mobo or something?

Amd,"Hello guys,

As I drift off to sleep, I was wondering on the consumer popularity of HBM since I have a R9 Fury Nitro and was thinking of getting a RX Vega 56 from eBay (XFX, not a blower one).

When the R9 Fury was released, it was the best that AMD offered and it's successors where no match for it (RX 480 and 580) but it came at an extreme cost of heat and power. Then the Vega series was released and it was a massive flop for gamers.

In terms of significance, do you you feel the R9 Fury was a greater leap than the Vega? I feel the R9 Fury was more significant leap for Radeon than Vega was because it was a new memory module that could compete with Nvidia's best (GTX 980Ti) while the Vega could only compete with GTX 1070Ti despite having so much time to improve on it. Gamers actually got their money's worth with Fury (I feel) because Nvidia's offering was similar price (please correct me if I am wrong) and get similar performance (GTX 980Ti was better but it was so overpowering as GTX 1080Ti was to Vega 64).

Between the Fury and the Vega, which series was more significant and why?

What are your thoughts?","Which was a more significant HBM series, R9 Fury or RX Vega?",hello guy drift sleep wonder consum popular hbm sinc r furi nitro think get rx vega ebay xfx blower one r furi releas best offer successor match rx came extrem cost heat power vega seri releas massiv flop gamer term signific feel r furi greater leap vega feel r furi signific leap radeon vega new memori modul could compet best gtx ti vega could compet gtx ti despit much time improv gamer actual got money worth furi feel offer similar price pleas correct wrong get similar perform gtx ti better overpow gtx ti vega furi vega seri signific thought signific hbm seri r furi rx vega
Amd,"I've run into quite a few people on AMD-centered reddit pages that seem to think TB3 doesn't work, or is difficult to get working on AMD builds. This is not the case, so here is some info/short guide.

This is my first AMD build in about 18 years (2700X/ASUS B450-F Gaming) and TB3 works pretty much perfectly. I can hotplug my TB3 NVMe drive, daisychain TB3-&gt;TB3/2, and my TB3 dock (CalDigit TS3+) works as expected thus far. I do quite a bit of TB3 flashing and fiddling on my Intel-based hackintoshes, so without even thinking about it employed the same techniques to get TB3 on this board. This board does not have a TB header, but if you have one you can try using it or you can short the pins as I have done.

You need:

1. Gigabyte Titan Ridge v1 or v2 (Alpine Ridge requires a BIOS component to fully initialize, so won't work without official support. Other Titan Ridge cards should work, but YMMV)
2. 5-pin header cable cut to have 1-2"" stub
3. Strip and twist pins 3 &amp; 5 together and then cover with electrical tape. With the tab facing up and towards you, pins are numbered 5-1 going left to right. See picture.
4. Install the latest Win10 driver for your TR card, then install the TB3 app from the Windows Store that is autosuggested by Win10.
5. Reboot, then you can hotplug devices. You will need to go into the app the first time you connect any TB3 device and confirm that you want the device to connect automatically in the future.

That's it. Really.

I heared someone on reddit say the other day that the pins on your mainboard and psu might not always aligh for 24 pin. thats spooky.

I was thinking about getting a  Fractal Design Ion+ 860P 860W ATX 2.4

because it's pretty much double the amount I need and i guess the uhm Efficency cuves are pretty okay with 400W ... but i also realize that my pc isnt always just draining 430 W this is when it's under heavy load  cpu and gpu wise so yeah i dont rly know

Amd,"Intel recently patched the workaround people were using to avoid the crippled AMD functions. 

I did some quick benchmarking to [prove the workaround no longer works](https://imgur.com/a/BXbEwtm). 

Generally, I see a straight up loss of 15-20% performance, due to Intel intentionally crippling software on AMD CPUs. (Other people have claimed much higher losses in other workloads.)

I want to know if AMD is ever going to comment on this issue? This is extremely serious for people doing scientific and computational work on AMD.

Amd,"Hi all, I am new to overclocking/tweaking so I am learning at I go. My base setup:

CPU: 3900x

GPU: 1080ti sc black

MOBO: C8H

RAM: 32 GB 3600 cl17-18-18-18

Cooling: open loop with 3 240 rads, both CPU and GPU are on the same loop

PSU: thermaltake toughpower grand rgb 850

Tweaks:

RAM AND IF: I tweaked the RAM UP to 3733 and have it at 1.39V (it might go lower voltage wise but this seemed to boot well so I can play with it more later). I then set the fclk to 1867 to couple it with the RAM speed

CPU: I turned PBO on with a 5x scalar, set 200mHz offset

Characteristics of tweaks: It gamed while streaming 1080p 60 fps for a few hours the other night with no hitches. Right now cinebench score is about 7230 or so with chrome open and lot of apps like discord running in the background (not great but not terrible, I will figure out how to shut down all background apps for a more reliable score soon). It passes intel burn test on High, but only hit 9 outputs on very high and 2 on maximum. My peak single core clock seems just shy of 4.4 GHz, I have never seen a single core reach 4.6. I am currently running prime95 large fft to test that the memory overclock is stable.

Main questions:

How to get better single core clocks? Not that the CPU is performing particularly bad per se but it would be nice to actually see 4.6 at some point.

Intel Burn test does not crash and temps never exceeds 75 deg (Ryzen master) but it still says system not stable at max and very high. I don't think it is cooling. Would fclk cause this? Anything I can do to improve stability?

Is there a direct test to ensure fclk is stable?

Amd,"Hey subs,

We're giving you an opportunity to start reporting some of your AMD-related technical issues right here on /r/AMD! Below is a guide that you should follow to make the whole process run smoothly. Post your issues directly into this thread as replies. **All other tech support posts will still be removed, per the rules; this is the only exception.**

----------------------------------------------------

##Bad Example (don't do this)

&gt;  
bf1 crashes wtf amd

________________________________________

##Good Example (please do this)

#Summary of Issue

&gt; Stuttering on Red Dead Redemption 2 when FreeSync is enabled, tends to occur on lower frame rates. Does not happen when FreeSync is disabled. Appears only on DP but not on HDMI. Does not show on single display.

#System Configuration

* **Motherboard:** Gigabyte B450 Aorus Pro Wifi
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- **PSU:** Corsair SF750W 80+ Platinum
- **Display(s)** *(Make, Model and Type):*
    - Viewsonic XG2401 DP (1080p 144Hz FreeSync)
    - Extended Samsung S2240B DP -&gt; Active DVI-D Dongle (1080p 60Hz)
- **System Memory:** 32GB Dual Channel 2132 MHz
* **GPU** *(VBIOS):* Powercolor Red Devil RX 5700XT 8GB (VBIOS: 017.001.000.049)
* **OS** *(Version):* Windows 10 x64 (Version: 19041.264) [how do I find this?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)
* **Driver:** Radeon Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.5.1
* **Applications:** Red Dead Redemption 2 Vulkan and DirectX 12
* **Background Apps:** Discord, Spotify, Firefox

I can't understand why so few reviewers don't make this kind of comparison. It shows very well of efficient CPUs are nowadays.It's a cheap math expression (Watt\*Minutes\*60=Joule), it isn't very accurate (total system consumption takes account RAM, SSD, Display consumption that can be different laptop by laptop) but indicates very well what a huge step AMD made with the Ryzen 4000 Mobile series.

UPDATE 2: Im gonna to do some of the suggestions of disabling XMP and setting it to auto as someone suggested and also I’ve seen a lot of people mention RMA being high with the red dragon and as my dad has the same card and has had zero issues I’m going to assume very possibly I get a bad card.


UPDATE - I have had a 5500xt ZERO ISSUES. To those assuming its my system or I haven't checked it. I have absolutely done so I'm not an idiot I factored in everything, PSU, CPU RAM etc, no faults on that end. thermals are solid the core issue is when the GPU is basically being told to do its JOB, boom a crash at some point will happen, the extent at which people are expecting me to go is pretty ridiculous aswell, the fact that I've not seen a single NVIDIA AMD related issue with drivers, graphics problems crashing should say something and stop blaming XMP. there are issues that need to be rectified here. AND STOP BEING BIAS.

CPU is amazing loving Ryzen.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had recently about 3 weeks ago built a new system, full AMD Ryzen 5 3600 RX 5700 XT, etc

But one of the many things that I have had to deal with since I've had that GPU is crashes of varying kinds full system crashes, game crashing etc, to this day and I'm now done with it I've spent numerous hours looking at 'possible' solutions fixes DDU methods for driver reinstall, disable every feature, stop the radeon software from running at all, going back to 2019 drivers, undervolting (worked for a while)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had so much pain and annoyance trying to use a GPU in its stock settings as much as this, any time I as a user has experienced a crash its been due to me pushing clocks a tad bit, and then that's it no further issues, but this damn thing has pissed me off I can't play a game without it either full crashing or crashing back to desktop I'm done I'm not considering an AMD GPU again its to much crap for one to deal with just to use it the way its supposed to work.

&amp;#x200B;

And to add to that, on numerous detailed posts it will usually end with them saying they just had to move on, throw the towel or I got a 2070s and everything's been amazing etc etc that right there just hits the nail on the head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done I'm pissed off I should've looked more into the cards which is my own fault to be fair, but I've just had it. I'm going green and staying green.

So my point is maybe ryzen 4000 it's just going to be a missed geration and amd will present ryzen 5000 for real this year  or at CES 2021 or maybe the ryzen 4000 will be just for a few limited unit just like intel did with their 5000 series.

Igors latest video came up an hour ago and it had some info / rumors on the big navi cards.
The written articles in german/english only cover the nvidia part of video for some reason, so if you dont speak german you have to trust me. (Or learn german :D)

The AMD part starts at about 13:40min.
According to him Big Navi with 275 watts is somewhere between 3070 and 3080 and possibly with more power consumption (300W+) somewhere around 3080 performance.
Big Navi will not be able to attack the 3090. Take this with a lot of salt.

The AIB part starts at 15:10min
He says the AIBs do not yet have a bill of material for the Big Navi cards. It takes roughly 3 month from the bill of material to product on the shelfs so every Big Navi card this year will come directly from AMD. He says if there somehow will be AIB cards this year then these will be rush jobs and come around christmas. The guy is very well connected within the industry, so this is as close a confirmation as one can get.

The last thing he said about AMD ist that they delay the Big Navi launch on purpose to the Ryzen launch so the CPU takes the spotlight. Salt for this one

Amd,"Besides the $1300+ 2080 ti, folks haven't had an actual upgrade from the 1080 ti - and many folks have been waiting for an upgrade for their GPUs for years. Despite what this sub might say, nVidia's suite of software are a huge deal - NVENC is a huge deal, RTX is a huge deal, DLSS is a huge deal.

Ampere is looking to be a massive generational leap from Turing while also bringing prices back in line with Pascal. We don't know about AMD's raytracing performance. We don't know about their rasterization performance. We don't know if AMD will even have a proper answer for DLSS, or NVENC, or a whole host of other nVidia software.

I want to have a reason to buy RDNA 2. But between all of this uncertainty and a history of driver issues, alongside what appears to be a worthwhile generational improvmenet with nVidia, it doesn't make sense for the average user to wait for AMD when in all likelihood nVidia will at worst still offer competitive cards and will almost definitely have the more stable drivers + better featureset.

AMD need to counter the mindshare that nVidia is cultivating. If they have something to offer that competes, now is the time to show their hand.

I changed the two hex values (power limit and current limit) that he pointed out, and applied the registry file. In the Radeon software, the slider definitely goes higher:

Amd," Hello reddit, I need some help with a build I was working today. I've only build 2 gaming PC's and both have been intel. My friend asked me to build one for him and I agreed. This are the specs [PC PARTS](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/QK9fNq)

As you can see this is my first time building one with an amd cpu but I guess that's not that important. The point is that I had a few problems building it and I'm gonna address the 3 big ones.

1. After connecting all components the pc started normally but the ssd wasn't showing up. Tried reseating it and nothing. I changed it to the other slot and it worked idk. Installed windows and everything was working fine. I then went to change the ram speed, I picked the xmp profile and changed it to 3600mhz. The pc went in a loop and couldn't even get to the BIOS. Had to reset cmos and then I left it in 2133(auto) and then it worked fine. (**RAM PROBLEM**)
2. The CPU was running at 60c idle. It went down sometimes to 45-50x but when installing a game it went up to 70c. I checked it was seated well and I took off the plastic from the hyper 212. I applied well the thermal paste. Just a lil dot size of a pea like I did to my previous builds which I had 0 problems.(**CPU TEMP**)
3. When I tried to run a game the PC just rebooted. I tried Doom Eternal and Far Cry New Dawn. I run the exe and in a few seconds it just restarts. (**RANDOM REBOOT**)

I felt so frustrated I didn't know what to do. We were both so hyped and know we're sad. I was so happy he was ascending to the master race and now I jsut don't know.

Amd,"These follow from the leaked configuration of 4 shader engines from rogame[1] and 2080Ti being 50% better than 5700XT at 4k[5]

Best case scenario : Almost 3090 performance.  
AMD double the ROPs[2], get enough memory bandwidth so that doubling of 5700XT config alone is worth 1.9X performance[3]. On top of that, 10% IPC improvement + around 20% better effective clocks[4], leading to 2.5X performance of 5700XT and so about 60-70% better than 2080Ti.     

Avg. case scenario : Within 10% of 3080 performance.  
AMD's doubling of 5700XT resources ends up in 1.7X performance of 5700XT at same clocks, 0-5% IPC improvement and 10-15% more due to higher effective clocks. Ends up 25-36% faster than 2080Ti.  

Worst case scenario : Equal to 3070    
AMD's ""doubling"" of 5700XT resources only yields about 1.5X performance[6], 0% IPC improvement and only 5-10% better effective clocks for only 55-65% better performance than 5700XT and about equal to custom 2080Tis with no power throttling.

Amd,"The amount of people on this subreddit saying AMD has two weeks to change their mind are naïve at best. AMD either has a:

1. Legit RTX 3080 competitor to boot, AMD doesn't want to give Nvidia the opportunity to change MSRP right before Ampere reviews go online. AMD also gets the opportunity either charge as much as the defeated RTX 3000 SKU or even higher if AMD feel bullish about it. Remember the words ""a Halo product"" a.k.a *we going to charge you for the privilege*. AMD cares margins, don't be deluded. If the product is as good or better then your pay the same price or better, it doesn't matter if they are the underdogs here. We would all like to see cheaper prices still but if people are impressed with Ampere pricing then don't bitch about AMD's pricing if they charge the exact same or slightly more for faster performance. AMD doesn't exist to make Nvidia lower prices. 
2. **OR** they don't have a proper answer yet again, which would be the 'ol Radeon VII vs RTX 2080 or Navi10 vs RTX 2070/2080 all over again.  In this case also they will price the SKUs poorly just like Navi10 before the review day price cuts. The only positive here being this time around they wont have the distinction of being 1 year late. Again don't be deluded, it will not be the end of Radeon group, there will still be takers for faster than RTX 3070 but slower than RTX 3080 with more VRAM at $499-549. Such a product will not worry Nvidia as they can simply release a 3070 SUPER with 16GB RAM and maybe faster clocks and more SMs enabled if the GA104 isn't already fully enabled on the RTX 3070 or have another GA102 cut even further down if they have some really poor dies on the GA 102.

In both the above cases AMD is only cared about the highest margins they can aim for and in a way it is understandable if you product isn't good enough, just focus on margins as you are not going to win a lot of consumers on merit. However if your product is actually good this time around then better don't give Nvidia room to adjust prices on Ampere's review day. This helps massively to put a good spin on AMD's launch on their review day while maintaining the margins they were aiming for.

When you see people in here looking to pre-order Ampere  before independent reviews are even out you just know they have already made up their minds and AMD not showing their hand is just a lousy excuse for them not being being able to get even cheaper Nvidias.

Am more focused on AMD's shit drivers, it wont matter how this thing performs so long as they are  priced right.

Amd,"Hi guys!

So the time has come for me to upgrade from the stock cooler, which I actually did like quite a bit. 
I have a few candidates already but want to hear some suggestions without influencing you, so here's some details. 

I don't intend to overclock (at least not any time soon), and if so, nothing major. 

I'm more interested in air coolers than AIOs. Although, since I plan on going for and RTX 3000 GPU when they come out, due to their back fan I might consider an AIO (depending on what tests show).
 
RGB is not a necessity but would be nice.

Amd,"Taking data from [this article posted](https://respawnfirst.com/amd-4800h-vs-intel-11th-gen-1165g7/) yesterday (which is an unfair comparison with 2 different classes of CPUs) and from [this comparison](https://www.notebookcheck.com/4800U-vs-4800H-vs-4700U_11681_11677_11683.247552.0.html), I wanted to get a quick look and compare these CPUs.I'm really curious if Intel's claims are true, especially in the graphics division.

There are more tests in there but I couldn't find the exact setup for the Ryzen CPUs, Blender would be nice but all the tests differ so they're not comparable. I'm not even sure these are the same, although Cinebench should be fine.

The 1165G7 seems to be a bit better than the 4700U graphics wise and has a better single score, but loses in multithreaded apps. Of course the 1185G7 is missing but the 4800U is also impossible to find, so 4700U vs 1165G7 seems to be where it's at.

Amd,"Putting this here instead of the Tech Support thread due to the fact I'm not experiencing technical issues as seems to be the purpose of that thread.

Three months ago I put together my first new rig in seven years and decided to go with the ASRock X570 Steel Legend. My friends had been pushing me to make a budget build instead of the high end build I originally planned for, so I felt a $200 motherboard was adequate and my old board was also an ASRock so I figured it would be perfectly fine.

I paired this board with a 2.75 slot EVGA 2070 Super FTW3 Ultra card. However, this card not only rests on top of the chipset heatsink, leaving no gap, but also covers a majority of the chipset fan. This has always bothered me, but for the past three months I seemingly haven't had any noticeable issues. After the recent reveal of NVIDIA's RTX 30 series cards, I decided I wanted to get a 3090, not just for gaming but also for professional use to chase my ideas for CG films and potentially video game development. However, this card is a full triple slot card and as a result would completely cover the chipset fan on my motherboard. I didn't budget for replacing my motherboard if the need is there, and looking at other boards most of them have the chipset fan in the exact same place regardless of the size of the board or manufacturer.

So my question is, do these chipset fans actually make a noticeable difference in temperatures? Or would covering it with a large GPU not change anything? 

A part of me also wonders if the reason I haven't had any issues is because the chipset is directly in front of my cases 140mm front intake fan which should pull cool air directly into the chipset and push the hot air out from underneath the heatsink.",How much do the chipset fans on X570 motherboards affect temps?,put instead tech support thread due fact experienc technic issu seem purpos thread three month ago put togeth first new rig seven year decid go asrock x steel legend friend push make budget build instead high end build origin plan felt motherboard adequ old board also asrock figur would perfectli fine pair board slot evga super ftw ultra card howev card rest top chipset heatsink leav gap also cover major chipset fan alway bother past three month seemingli notic issu recent reveal rtx seri card decid want get game also profession use chase idea cg film potenti video game develop howev card full tripl slot card result would complet cover chipset fan motherboard budget replac motherboard need look board chipset fan exact place regardless size board manufactur question chipset fan actual make notic differ temperatur would cover larg chang anyth part also wonder reason issu chipset directli front case mm front intak fan pull cool air directli chipset push hot air underneath heatsink much chipset fan x motherboard affect temp

Amd,"Follow this procedure to fix the issue of game profiles not saving between reboots. Keep in mind that the custom profile will be reset if your PC BSODs or black screens or if you uninstall the driver entirely. This is by design. I recommend saving your custom profiles to C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Local\\AMD\\CN once you've created them to quickly recover from resets. A reinstall using factory reset or using DDU will result in having to do this again.

But following these steps will insure your game profiles WILL survive reboots now. As it was supposed to do.

1. Open file explorer and navigate to C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Local\\ATI\\ACE\\APL
2. Right click on User.blb.
3. Click properties.
4. Click the security tab.
5. Click Advanced.
6. Click Add.
7. Click ""Select a principal""
8. Type ""Everyone"" (no quotes)  in the box.
9. Click the Check Names button. **EVERYONE** should appear underlined.
10. Click ok.
11. Check the box labeled ""full control"" all other boxes should also check automatically.
12. Click ok to close the box.
13. Click apply.
14. Click ok again to close the box.
15. Click ok to close the final box.
16. Done.

**Note: If you are STILL seeing the profiles delete upon reboot, instead of adding them from the list click the plus sign and manually add the profile. The list uses the game profiles that were discovered by the initial scan that is performed upon the installation of the driver and some of these (steam games mostly) seem to not have the permissions required to actually write to the User.blb file. This is solved by manually adding them via the plus sign as noted in the image below.**

Amd,"I am basing my opinion on the info that has been already confirmed but there’s a good chance I have mess everything up here, if so feel free to correct me. 

Let's start. We know that navi 21 is 506mm and rx 5700XT is 250mm die size. We know AMD has said 50% improvement in performance per watt. We also know they have thrown around 1.2x IPC improvement and higher boost clock speed of at least 2.2ghz(PS5) which will give us another 1.2x boost in performance. 

Let's look at the power usage first. We know 5700xt used about 200 Watts (Memory excluded). Since we have double the size we will just double the power usage based on RDNA1 figures to 400W. Now apply 1.5x performance per watt improvement brings that down to 300W so about same as 3080. 

Let's look at the performance now, 2080ti is 40% ahead of 5700xt on Average. Since we double the Compute units on Navi 21 let's assume for now we double the performance of 5700xt to 2x for Navi 21, now lets add in 1.2x IPC improvement and 1.2x clock speed advantage we get 2.88x performance of 5700xt lets bring that down to 2.1x because performance increases with more CU's is not linear usually. Now the question is how does that compare to 3080? 

Lets see if we can figure that out, 3080 is claimed by nvidia as 1.5x better than 2080ti and 2080ti itself is 1.4x better than 5700 xt so multiplying all those AMD would need to have at least 2.1x performance increase to reach this level. So it seems like Navi 21 will be ahead at 2.88x in ideal case and 2.1x likely but barely and now we know why nvidia launched 3080 at lower price. 

AMD will beat this but Nvidia will just launch 3080ti and come out ahead again. However it’s not going to be an all Nvidia this time around. AMD will be competitive at the high end except for 3080ti and 3090. AMD might not have an answer for those. However costing more than 800 those will be very high end enthusiast cards anyways. Another advantage Nvidia has over AMD is DLSS, I don’t know how many people care about that but for me it's not a big deal. If AMD prices Navi 21 below 3080 price as they usually do, I'll be glad to pick one up if all this hold true.

Amd,"Hi there,

its driving me nuts, so I am asking for some advice from you people, maybe I miss something:

I am running some esxi hosts (7, 6.7) and I wanted to enhance one of them with a shared or dedicated GPU.

Now, there are basically

\- MxGPU-types, which is SR-IOV, which enables sharing one card with different VMs concurrently

\- direct pcie passthrough-GPUs to ONE VM only

I would like to use it for remote gaming (hence, I need graphics-function) and secondly use the card for number crunching / ML.

This is a homelab setup, so I do not need to do both at the same time; also, it could be two cards as well. dont want to spent more than say 1000€.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is: I just cannot find any AMD-card that supports any of the above (in a remote setup); I need the integration with ESXi / vmware, so that box can stay in the cellar.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldnt find any up-to-date information from AMD as well; NVIDIA is out because of potential licensing cost. 

please please let me know how to get more information!!!

Amd,"First and foremost, I love AMD and was a huge advocate for them as the underdog. I'm a shareholder for Christ's sake (bought at $2.53/share and still hodling, thanks for the retirement fund AMD) but the state of Big Navi is pretty dire and I don't think a lot of you realize how bad this is.

It won't matter how great Big Navi is because we're lacking such major features. On top of the negative brand perception associated with all the driver issues we've been hearing about from the AMD camp for the last year due to the 5700XT, a lack of dedicated hardware for ray tracing and an equivalent for DLSS2.0 is just another nail in the coffin.

Why would anyone give a shit about a hypothetical 10% increase in rasterization from a card that is entirely focused on rasterization when it comes at the loss of DLSS2.0 (2X performance on the lower end, better visual fidelity), potentially worse driver support and having to choose between ray tracing or frame rate when nvidia users can enable DLSS2.0+ray tracing and still come out on top performance-wise **and** visually?

Their Radeon software partnerships haven't been anything to write home about lately either. Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Borderlands 3 from recent memory? Can you blame the average consumer looking at AMD and rolling their eyes and perceiving it as the ""inferior brand"" with those being the flagship ""optimized"" titles? 

Anyways coming from an AMD enthusiast that bought the Radeon VII knowing fully well that it would be outperformed by nvidia equivalents in the same pricing tier, the state of things are pretty dire. Even coming from me, giving up dedicated hardware for ray tracing+DLSS and praying that AMD doesn't shit the bed with drivers this time is too much of an ask for the average consumer.","It won't matter how good Big Navi is at pure rasterization, why would anyone give up DLSS and dedicated hardware ray tracing?",first foremost love huge advoc underdog sharehold christ sake bought share still hodl thank retir fund state big navi pretti dire think lot realiz bad matter great big navi lack major featur top neg brand percept associ driver issu hear camp last year due xt lack dedic hardwar ray trace equival dlss anoth nail coffin would anyon give shit hypothet increas raster card entir focus raster come loss dlss x perform lower end better visual fidel potenti wors driver support choos ray trace frame rate user enabl dlss ray trace still come top perform wise visual radeon softwar partnership anyth write home late either horizon zero dawn ghost recon breakpoint borderland recent memori blame averag consum look roll eye perceiv inferior brand flagship optim titl anyway come enthusiast bought radeon vii know fulli well would outperform equival price tier state thing pretti dire even come give dedic hardwar ray trace dlss pray shit bed driver time much ask averag consum matter good big navi pure raster would anyon give dlss dedic hardwar ray trace

Amd,"So I've had ups and downs over the past few months when it comes to my gaming PC. Back at the start of May, my  Powercolor RX 5700 started black screening. When I would play any game, it would play for 30 minutes then black screen. I contacted AMD support and I did all of their suggestions. Nothing worked. Eventually, they steered me over to Powercolor and I jumped through the same hoops with them.

After almost a month of correspondence and troubleshooting, they asked me to send in my card. They told me that it should only take two weeks then decide what the best course of action would be. I promptly sent them my card then didn't hear back from them for over a month. I sent in tech support tickets and emailed their support. Never heard anything from them. It wasn't until I started posting on their Twitter and Instagram about the troubles I had been having that they got into contact with me.

Someone on their Instagram started responding to my private messages and got me into contact with one of their support people. This support person sent me an email that I was receiving a replacement card and I got it within three days. I wiped all previous drivers and installed the new ones, did various things to make sure that the card would work on the first try. I popped in the card. It didn't work. The fans didn't spin up at the start like the previous card had or anything. I called my brother and went over to his house. We installed the AMD drivers and put the card in. Nothing.

I started to get pissed at this point so I contacted Powercolor support. I told them that they sent me a dead card and they asked me to go through the suggestions to see if anything worked. I have been talked to them for over a week, explaining that none of the suggestions work. They then asked me to get into contact with AMD and send it into one of the technicians to test it.

I have been beyond frustrated with their customer support and how long it has taken to get things done. I just want my computer back and be able to game on it. Thankfully, my sister has been letting me borrow the graphics card I purchased for her PC while she saves up money for the rest of her computer parts.

Amd,"- So far it seems it will be about doubled above the 5700XT chip so 80CU (this would already put the chip well into 2080ti+ territory as 2080Ti is about 50% faster (worst case scenario) than the 5700XT)

- Clock speeds should be about 20-25% higher than the RDNA1 cards (based on RDNA2 GPU in PS2 already running at 2.2GHz, and the Big Navi will be based on even newer design library). so instead if 1.7ish GHz around 2-2.1GHz  (as NV went with 320-350W cards AMD don't really need to cut back the clock speeds and we know TSMC 7nm has better power consumption than Samsung 8nm)

- Addition to the above is the architectural improvements going from RDNA1 to RDNA2

- Notice that NV compared the 3080 to the 2080 not the 2080S. 3080 is about 70% faster than 2080 that makes it about 2X faster than the 5700XT. So all the above improvements and the Navi chip size considered the Big Navi cards should be around 3080 performance or above.

Amd,"As we know Navi 2X (aka Big Navi) and Ryzen 4000 desktop (Zen 3) will be coming to the market lately 2020. (According to [tomshardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-big_navi-rdna2-all-we-know), it will be October for Navi 2X) AMD should have a launch unveil stream on the internet (Nothing is confirmed, I just assume they will do it) and they should take notes on how to market and package their own presentation. 

Nvidia did a much better job of revealing their new GPU than Intel's Tiger lake unveil. Mostly is because Nvidia is God of marketing (hence people do fall for their marketing) and they have delivered a clear and focus message towards the customers. Also, they focused on their own product rather than compare their products against their competitors. Nvidia is really packaging Geforce RTX is THE gaming experience that you want for the 3000 series and it is the best thing you can get. 

Unlike Nvidia, Intel's launch is clustered and not as focus. After watch Gamer Nexus video on Intel's unveil, it is clear to me that Intel is trying to prove something. That their cores are superior to AMD's cores and you shouldn't be getting more cores for your ultra laptops; That they have more specialised accelerators than AMD; That their mobile 4 cores chips are more cable than AMD's 8 cores chips. A lot of the times, Intel is marketing their against their competitor, instead of marketing their CPU as a complete package

Certainly, AMD's marketing will take notes (I hope) for their up and coming launch. I really think that AMD should really avoid comparing their GPU against Nvidia and tell people the message that AMD is coming back to the high end and they are ready to provide ""high"" end experience. I think every time they sell it as an equivalent to/ better than Nvidia on the launch show, they just give people the impression of this will be 10 per cent slower than Nvidia or this is the value option for people. They should put in in a decent cooler (That blower design is bad, so make it a duo-axial fan with proper and sufficient cooling) and tell people how much performance it has (in the best light without overstating it). They really should show people how much they have improved on performance per watt. since Fury to Polaris to Vega to Navi 1 to Navi 2. I can assure you that it will be mind-blowing (According to [techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt/31.html), RX 590, Vega 56 consume around the same amount of energy, yet in 1440p and 4K relative performance it is 70% faster than RX 590 and 30% faster than Vega 56) They really should sell on what they can do instead of how similar they are with their competitor. For the CPU side, stop with the physics score from 3Dmark. That's just nonsense. We want to buy your products and we want to know what's ""truly"" capable. Tell us how efficient you are comparing to your past generation and you can compare to Intel's 10 gen. Tell us how your CPU games and just don't compare to Intel, tell us how much you've improved since Zen 1. Tell us why your products are more premium and better than what people think.

This is big

One thing that really disappointed a lot of folks with the Nvidia launch was that the 3070 has 8 gigs, and 3080 has 10 gigs. I was one of them, I wanted to see at least 12 gigs on 3070 and 16 gigs of 3080.

Now I want to share a personal story 

When my 770GTX died I was debating between a 970 2 GB and a 970 4GB. Their was I believe a $50 price difference between the two models. At the time people were telling me ""For $50 the extra 2 GB doesn't matter, bench marks are the same blah blah""

I went with the 4 GB and that card is still holding up in 2020. Looking at my VRAM usage I'm 100% confident had I not gotten the 4 GB card my GPU wouldn't be as useful as it is.

With the rise of 1440P gaming, and also the fact that new GPUs will be able to pull data straight from the SSDs/NVME drives themselves having more VRAM is critical. Going in the future I think VRAM will be even more important.

I bet if AMD drops a card, 16 gigs, performs somewhere between a 3070 and 3080 and prices it at $549 it'll sell like hot cakes.",Big Navi With 16 Gigs Expected To be $549,tweaktown news nvidia cheap amper card forc big navi gb price index html big one thing realli disappoint lot folk launch gig gig one want see least gig gig want share person stori gtx die debat gb gb believ price differ two model time peopl tell extra gb matter bench mark blah blah went gb card still hold look vram usag confid gotten gb card use rise p game also fact new gpu abl pull data straight ssd nvme drive vram critic go futur think vram even import bet drop card gig perform somewher price sell like hot cake big navi gig expect

Amd,Looking at Nvidias insane power draw for a 3080 at 250 watt fitting this to a mobile form factor at 110 tdp would severely cripple the card performance. 3070 isn’t that power efficient either judging by Amd S claim rdna2 is 50 percent more efficient than rdma1 I’m willing it has great potential as a good dgpu solution .. most likely it won’t dethrone the 3000 Nvidia series just because of the ridiculous CUDA core count that surprised everyone .

Amd,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with the ASUS ROG RX 5700 XT (the first model, not the EVO released few months ago) since it got very bad reviews due to high temperatures and instability. I bought the card pretty cheap few weeks ago and I tested it with games and Unigine Superposition. I never had any kind of issue but i played a little with Wattman to see if i can get some improvements.
Long story short I've found the stock voltage is too high (but this is not news) and I want to share my undervolt settings to reduce temperatures and in some cases even improve performance with lower voltage and better temps. Of course these settings can be applied to all rx 5700 xt.
My configuration: CPU I7-8700, RAM 16gb 2666mhz, room temp 28°celsius, open case with good ventilation.
Benchmark: Unigine Superposition, 1080p HIGH (I tried also 1080p EXTREME and results in temps were almost identical).
RESULTS (core frequency/voltage/ram frequency):

STOCK 2090/1200/1500: score 11816, fps avg 88,38, core°65, vram°78, hotspot°80 -  
      1800/950/1775:  score 11603, fps avg 86,79, core°59, vram°72, hotspot°71 -  
      1900/1000/1775: score 12117, fps avg 90,63, core°61, vram°74, hotspot°75 -  
      1950/1000/1775: score 12565, fps avg 92,44, core°61, vram°75, hotspot°76 -  
      2060/1095/1775: score 12904, fps avg 96,52, core°64, vram°78, hotspot°85.

the results speaks by themselves and even hotspot of 85° I think is acceptable. So you can figure out which configuration is better for you. Considering the room temp is pretty high i'm sure when summer is over these temps can be few degrees lower.

Amd,"Schenker is [asking](https://forms.gle/EyzjqAMfPLxQUhuJ7) if we _really_ want higher res laptops than FHD.  Evidently this is not obvious to manufacturers.  Currently there are almost zero options for UHD or even WQHD.  Even the Zephyrus G14 seems to only actually be shipping the FHD screen.  Every time I look at my older FHD screen after spending time on a higher res screen, I feel like I'm staring into the abyss except the abyss is filled with endlessly disappointing low-res garbage.

I don't know how popular this customer need is, but it's a shut up and take my money deal breaker for me.  My bank account is effectively frozen until I get a good UHD option.  I have a FHD laptop.  I don't use it.  I'm not going to buy another one.  Evidently we need to make some noise online because we can't vote with our dollars yet.

Shenker's website still only offers the low-res, primitive, immeasurably useless and disappointing FHD.  The Zephyrus G14, which was supposed to have a cool LED back display with a mediocre (and dim) WQHD option has been ""sold out"" for months.  Lenovo, nothing.  Amazon, would you like one of our 80 options for a FHD G14?  Newegg, here's your Surface Pro.  I want a low-power chip with a billion cores and a high resolution display.

OP will not respond to this thread.  OP is aware that many consumers never realized DPI was a setting.  OP is aware that high refresh rates and low resolution go together because laptops sometimes can't render WQHD at 60+Hz except on [these extremely popular esports titles] and [these other 600 games as long as you turn down 1-2 settings, such as rendering resolution].  OP really needs a mobile workstation with options.  Obama out.

_Edit:  OP has confirmed that nobody knows how to set DPI, not even Linux users. OP is meant to suffer among people who have such terrible eyesight that they think text looks as sharp on FHD as it does on 4k in spite of half as many pixels per glyph.

Amd,"First of all, I know some of you say stuff like ""AMD won't benefit from a price drop"" or even ""AMD should price their GPUs even higher if the performance is better"". I don't think that matches the realities in the market. Also, the opposite was very much true with Zen. Zen couldn't beat Intel, but it was such a HUGE VALUE, that people continued to ignore the slight difference in performance and the Intel brand with each new Zen generation.

Second, it's pretty certain Nvidia will drop its prices for these GPUs the moment AMD's GPUs start shipping - at least 10% is my guess. And it would look bad for AMD to launch a 3070 equivalent for $450, only for Nvidia to match it at $450 or even drop to $430, and then for AMD to have to drop it to $400 days later. I think they made this mistake before with RDNA 1, right?

So the price difference needs to be pretty significant and incorporate the expectation that Nvidia will also drop its prices by 10-15% then.

If AMD can afford the margins at all, I think $350-$370 for 3070 equivalent and $550-$580 for 3080 equivalent would be great prices, and more importantly it will give AMD a ton of LOVE, appreciation, and ultimately MINDSHARE, just like they got with Zen.

I think this is the only way to beat Nvidia's brand and hype right now. Make its products have UNDENIABLE VALUE that no reviewer can ignore, and they are FORCED to begrudgingly recommend AMD's GPUs even if they come with the ""caveat"" that AMD's GPUs win ""only"" by having *much better value* than Nvidia's GPUs.

Again, this is exactly the tone the majority of Zen reviews had at the time, but it was still ultimately a HUGE WIN for AMD that reviewers even admitted to that and didn't focus purely on benchmarks or ""stability"", driver issues, software support, etc. AMD could repeat that with with RDNA2, even if the same issues could apply to AMD's cards vs Nvidia's cards.","UNDENIABLE VALUE: Would $370 for 3070-equivalent, and $580 for 3080 equivalent make it a NO-BRAINER for you to choose AMD?",first know say stuff like benefit price drop even price gpu even higher perform better think match realiti market also opposit much true zen zen beat intel huge valu peopl continu ignor slight differ perform intel brand new zen gener second pretti certain drop price gpu moment gpu start ship least guess would look bad launch equival match even drop drop day later think made mistak rdna right price differ need pretti signific incorpor expect also drop price afford margin think equival equival would great price importantli give ton love appreci ultim mindshar like got zen think way beat brand hype right make product undeni valu review ignor forc begrudgingli recommend gpu even come caveat gpu win much better valu gpu exactli tone major zen review time still ultim huge win review even admit focu pure benchmark stabil driver issu softwar support etc could repeat rdna even issu could appli card vs card undeni valu would equival equival make brainer choos

Amd,"Hi Guys,

I am a total newbie to overclocking and would like to be educated. I have bought a Ryzen 3590x and my motherboard is a Aorus x570i (mini tix). I have some questions regarding overclocking.

background: I am going to be using this PC for backtesting forex using MT4. MT4 is a single core single threaded application. I keep hearing and reading that you can run multiple ones and you get the best results by assigning each process to its own core. **given that MT4 is a single threaded single core application (its too old to utilize all cores). I plan to run 16 instances of it**

1. **will over clocking my 3590x help me?**
2. I keep hearing overclocking lowers single core performance.  

   1. is that true?
   2. would this hurt me or help me ?
3. I keep hearing about ""all core"" over clocking and ""single core"" (each core) over clocking  

   1. is that true? what is that
   2. what this be better? would this help me?

I know the basis of overclocking; manage the performance of the card, often to improve and get more performance. What I don't understand is what each thing does, how it affects the card, and how to know what I'm doing without a video telling me to use these settings.

If you can enlighten me here or find some videos that actually teach these things rather than just showing you what numbers you should use, that would be fantastic.

Amd," 

Hi,

I'm  in the process of making a whole new rig before november in   preparation for Cyberpunk and WoW: Shadowlands (27th of October).

My  current PC is quite old, rocking a gtx 970 and i7-6700k. I'd really   like to get an rtx 3080 when it becomes available, hopefully at launch.

My  problem is I'm not sure how to deal with the CPU. Ideally I'd love  to  grab one of the new Ryzen 4000 that are supposedly going to release   soon, but it might be too late before Cyberpunk and Shadowlands come   out.

Especially for shadowlands  that I've been waiting for quite a while now  and would love to play  with maxed settings. I can deal with waiting a  bit to play Cyberpunk.

The options I see are:

\-Buy an older, cheaper CPU (like a ryzen 3) to put on the new rig until Ryzen 4000 comes out

\-Buy the rtx 3080 and use it with the current pc that I have (i7-6700). How much of a bottleneck would that be?

\-Buy  a Ryzen 9 (or 7) now and if needed upgrade in the future. (But I  think  4000 will be the last cpu gen with this socket, right? So  upgrading in  the future will warrant a mobo upgrade too)

I'm here to ask if someone more expert than me could help me decide which option is better, or give new ideas.

I built my PC years ago but I stopped reading tech news, so I'm quite rusty.

I appreciate a lot any help I get.

Thanks in advance to everybody.","New PC before november, CPU help and ideas",hi process make whole new rig novemb prepar cyberpunk wow shadowland th octob current pc quit old rock gtx k realli like get rtx becom avail hope launch problem sure deal ideal love grab one new ryzen supposedli go releas soon might late cyberpunk shadowland come especi shadowland wait quit would love play max set deal wait bit play cyberpunk option see buy older cheaper like ryzen put new rig ryzen come buy rtx use current pc much bottleneck would buy ryzen need upgrad futur think last gen socket right upgrad futur warrant mobo upgrad ask someon expert could help decid option better give new idea built pc year ago stop read tech news quit rusti appreci lot help get thank advanc everybodi new pc novemb help idea

Amd,"So, the RTX 3000 announcement was the nail in the coffin on what has been a very long, buggy, black screeny, crashy,  5 months with my AORUS 5700xt. It’s done this to the point in which I think I have a semi faulty GPU and I do not exaggerate when I say that I’ve “tried everything”

Symptoms (confirmed on every driver including the beta HWS since nov 2019) 

\- Horrible stutter in call of duty warzone at seemingly random times which needs a system reboot to correct and can often cause you to throw the game as your aim goes off

\- Screen randomly flashes to total black screen/no signal on launch of apex legends after waking from sleep/pc running for longer than 30 min 

\- google chrome consistently crashing with hardware acceleration enabled If I’m multitasking 

 \- HDMI/DP audio distorted and crackly on the desktop making youtube almost unwatchable, this problem has gotten worse over time

\- monitor can take 20+ seconds to wake up and receive signal after mouse is moved/pc woken from sleep (monitor is not faulty, tested working with same cables on intel HD graphics)

\-  rare system hard hang at idle forcing reboot when using a lower wattage power supply wtih a 650w+ 12v rail (have tried 3 different known working PSU's)

\- the main problem is I can't put my system to sleep as if I open up apex legends after i wake it from sleep the monitor will flash to black and I need to hold down the power button in order to restart it and restart the driver

I've tried the following plus more to fix the issues:

\- Contact gigabyte/aorus support and try each of their suggestions multiple times

\- Contact AMD Support via email and via reddit and tried all of their suggestions multiple times including ""wait for a stable driver to come out (5 months)""

\- DDU + clean install of drivers on every driver since november 2019, plus trying the hardware scheduling driver

\- disabling the radeon overlay, enhanced sync, freesync (helps but symptoms but they still appear more rarely) + who the hell wants to game without freesync these days if my monitor supports it plus they can't advertise it as being freesync compatible then have you not be actually able to use it.

\- three different quality power supplies, Aerocool 675W 80 white, corsair 750w 80 silver, and now on a seasonic 1000 platinum, and yes also tried two cables from the psu to the 8 pins which helps stability but doesnt solve the problem

\- Changing every component in my system over from x79 to brand new x299 bar my SSD and the GPU in question

\- clean, fresh reinstall of windows, drivers and updates (twice)

\- Disabling fast boot and hybrid sleep

\- Disabling PCIE link state power statement

\- Mobo Bios updates and optimised defaults with xmp on / off on both x79 and x299

\- Vbios updates (none available for the card)

\- monitoring temperatures (all fine)

plus many more, if you can think of it and comment it down below then I've probably done it.

\~

The killer for me is the fact that I'm unable to use sleep without the GPU drivers becoming unstable, as it just makes it so damn inconvenient having to shut down my system every time I have to duck away for something such as brushing my teeth or to eat a meal. Also I love the freesync/gsync feature on my monitor so not being able to use it like was advertised is a total bummer if i want more stability.

I believe this GPU chip is on the verge of a failing bin, and because the aorus card clocks so high (1950mhz) it's not actually fully stable at this speed which is the source of my problems.

The law in my country (Australia) states that if a product is not fit for purpose as advertised the consumer has the right to return it for a refund or replacement. I would say this graphics card doesn't even meet the minimum requirements of being a graphics card if it removes your ability to put your computer to sleep or multitask without google chrome crashing.

\- GPU : Nivdia RTX 2060 or RTX 3060 ( If my Parents allow )

\- RAM : G Skill Trident Z Royal - Gold/ Silver (max. supported frequency by CPU, For R3 3300x - 3200 MHz )

\- Storage - Any 1 TB  Sata 6GB/s SSD

Amd,"Now that RTX 3070/3080 has been made official and reddit seems to think AMD's GPU division is DED, time to look at some public and historical data about GPU past and future to see if that's really the case.

First, let's establish the baseline performance at RTX 2080, since Nvidia's comparison and Digital Foundry's initial impression is base on that card. The 3080 should be 180% the performance, while the current biggest Navi, 5700XT, is about 84%.

&amp;#x200B;

||Prf|$ MSRP|TDP|Prf/$|Prf/W|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3080|180%|700|320|25.71|56.25|
|2080|100%|800|225|12.5|44.44|
|5700XT|84%|400|225|21.02|37.36|

Given that AMD had made claims about 50% increase in Prf/W, we can extrapolate where Navi 2X's performance can land.

&amp;#x200B;

|Prf vs 3080|$ MSRP|TDP|Prf/$|Prf/$ Delta|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|70%|500|225|25.22|\-1.93%|
|78%|500|250|28.02|\+8.97%|
|78%|600|250|23.35|\-9.19%|
|92%|500|295|33.06|\+28.58%|
|92%|600|295|27.55|\+7.15%|
|92%|700|295|23.62|\-8.16%|

&amp;#x200B;

It probably makes no sense for AMD to keep the same TDP as 5700XT. At $500 that card will have lower Prf/$ than the 3080 and much worse performance. Most likely AMD will bring it up to 295 watt, same TDP as Vega 64 and Vega VII. This means Navi 2X will be 92% of 3080 and if priced at $600 or lower, better prf/$.

AMD's plan was likely to be 295 watt at $699 MSRP, same class as Vega VII. However, Nvidia decided to put the screw on this round and took that spot with a faster card. AMD can still compete in the upper-mid range and prf/$, but short of breaking out the water blocks and eating the BOM, it's unlikely we will have a direct 3080 competitor.",Speculation on price/performance/power on Navi 2X now that RTX 3080 is announced,rtx made offici reddit seem think divis ded time look public histor data past futur see realli case first let establish baselin perform rtx sinc comparison digit foundri initi impress base card perform current biggest navi xt x b prf msrp tdp prf prf w xt given made claim increas prf w extrapol navi x perform land x b prf vs msrp tdp prf prf delta x b probabl make sens keep tdp xt card lower prf much wors perform like bring watt tdp vega vega vii mean navi x price lower better prf plan like watt msrp class vega vii howev decid put screw round took spot faster card still compet upper mid rang prf short break water block eat bom unlik direct competitor specul price perform power navi x rtx announc

Amd,"So, with the inevitable splashdown of RTX 3000 series, which on paper does seem amazing - some tech reviewers are already skeptical about Ampere's presentation.  
[Hardwareluxx.de has already opened up their opinions regarding the incredible performance claims with the upcoming Ampere GPUs](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/54008-was-wir-ueber-die-geforce-rtx-3000-serie-wissen-und-was-nicht.html) - and it's the standard: 
&gt; Watch out for cherry picking and wait for reviews.  
[Hardware unboxed seems to agree - until everyone can actually test it, hold your horses](https://twitter.com/HardwareUnboxed/status/1301124919812435968) as it's basically counting yer chicken before they hatch.


However, the other side of the picture is missing. With great claims, come the ""great"" comments from tech experts, saying ""AMDead"" and the such. Those incredibly intellectually gifted people apparently have an incredible amount of inside info which not even the most famous leakers have.  

Jokes aside, we have a great deal of info regarding what is coming inside the package of ""Big Navi"" - 16GB, NOT 512 bit bus, GDDR6, 80 CUs, the nuts.  
However, there are some things that can't be taken out of spec sheets, such as IPC. However, IPC isn't be all and end all of performance either.  

IPC is a measure how many instructions are done per cycle or clock. However, destructuring that even more is something we can't actually do, but matters even more.  

Let's go a bit deeper into this.
If your IPC is 1, and your frequency is 1 Hz, it means you are firing off an instruction that handles any of the required processes to render an image - once every single second. However, there is a metric in there that is not exactly forgotten about, but something that's hard to quantify - are those instructions good.  
  
*Let's say you have a kids toy puzzle - the one in which you insert different shapes in their respective holes. The IPC would be how often you attempt to put in a shape, and the instruction is what determines which shape goes where. You can try to do a LOT of different combinations, and the faster you do it, the higher your instructions per cycle are. However, getting those shapes right in the first few tries.  
To clear this up - this is a very simplistic explanation of the relation between the two - and it's definitely not the best but it works well enough*.  

Okay, so - now that you *sort of* know what's going on under the hood, you can tie together a few things: 
*Drivers are definitely tied to this. If your instruction set gets a null pointer - something the GPU is not ""trained/instructed"" to do, you get a black screen.  
*Having outdated instruction sets can also cause you to slow down the processing of the image, causing performance stutters. 
*Drivers are easier to create and fix when you don't have a lot of exceptions, null pointers, many-to-many relations and other stuff that is probably not relevant to you.
*RNDA1 was a problematic architecture for this reason, among others. It incorporates RDNA **and** GCN elements, causing basically mass hysteria and confusion on the poor lil PCB, what results in crashes and whatnot.  

This obviously means that THIS should no longer be a problem with RDNA2 - for humans it's like trying to make coherent sentences in 2-3 different languages, and one of them you know by watching anime regardless of how savory it is.  

Now, this doesn't mean RDNA2 won't have its problems - but to know them we'll have to wait and see.  

What we **do** know about RDNA2 is that AMD's CVP seems [fairly confident and up-to-date regarding nVidia's release and people's opinions on what AMD can and cannot do](https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1300842481886662658).  
Furthermore, [some of the leakers seem *very* adamant AMD has something pretty damn good waiting for us](https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1300464910019690505).  
Now, the last component we can speculate on is price. This one is pretty straight forward - it usually doesn't matter how much it costs to produce, what matters is the end result. AMD will stack their products in line with nVidia, but not low enough to lose money on the products. The exceptions are ""Prosumer"" GPUs like Radeon7, which used a super expensive tech, which was likely already under profit margins.  

AMD never ""chased"" nVidia. Lisa is smart enough to know that if you go ""after"" someone, you're bound to be behind them. They placed a decent, mid range product on the market, shown that they CAN make a good GPU in terms of actual hardware, now they are 100% invested into making something actually competitive.   
  
If you're old enough to remember, it's sorta like what happened with GTX 200 series, and AMD's HD 3000 series. nVidia went mental with the 295, drawing lots of power, and outright being the fastest.  
But AMD went opposite way. Smaller, fast GPUs at a lower price point, not taking the Halo product crown, but taking the price/performance crown by a good margin.  

Don't get too hyped, but don't write AMD off just yet. They took Intel by surprise even though they couldn't make a good CPU in almost a decade. They've made plenty good GPUs, this is just the 1st time in a while they're going for the high end market.

Amd,"I am neither making this post to get a lot of attention nor care for the karma, I just want to get my thoughts written down and have some discussion.. Hate keeping things in my head then rehashing them over and over.

...Okay here goes...

As we all know, the 5700XT chip was a mid-range chip. I would speculate that AMD could have offered a bigger chip, either 64CUs or possibly even 80 CUs but the power these bigger chips would have required was just too great for AMD to launch them against Turing. I would think a 80CU chip would have been pushing 350W+ **if clocked around 2Ghz**. The increase to 80CUs probably would have yielded around 35-40% improvement in performance, assuming the memory bandwidth was increased to accommodate this. (Improvement is not linear!)

With a 40% performance improvement, the 80CU chip would have still lost to the 2080Ti by around 10% at 4K. *(I am assuming the 2080Ti is 50% faster at 4K, this is debatable but is going to be my assumption for this discussion*). At 350W, this would have been unacceptable for AMD to release. Plus I don't think they wanted to waste R&amp;D money for a high-end product that had mixed architecture.

Normally we see about a 25% performance improvement at the high end, gen to gen on a year to 1.5 year cycle. Taking this into consideration and using 50fps as a baseline for the math, an 80CU Navi21 chip should perform as follows: 50fps x 1.40 = 70fps (*Theoretical 80CU Navi1X*) , 70 fps x 1.25 = 87.5 fps (*Theoretical 80CU Navi21*).

At 87.5 fps, this would be a 75% performance increase. (87.5/50 = 1.75) Which is about 25% over the 2080Ti at 4K. This performance also looks to line up with some early rumors. So far, I have seen demos showing the 3080 performing about 30-50% better than the 2080ti at 4K (*assuming tests are without DLSS or RT*).

25% better than a 2080TI will not catch the 3080 and only beat the 3070 by about 15-20% which is why I think we are now seeing rumors of a 16GB 3070Ti/S. I think Nvidia is waiting for AMD to announce Big Navi between the 3070 and 3080, and then hit them with the 3070Ti/S. I am hoping AMD can come up with a little more magic to get Big Navi's performance equal to or over that of the 3080.

So, how would they do that? I did see rumors of a dual pipeline for the shaders I think? Sounds very similar to Nvidia's FP32x2 but I could be wrong, someone reading please dive deeper on this. How else? A 96 CU chip or use HBM2? Any thoughts? What is the power target for Navi21? 300W? How far could they go to match the 3080?

**I have not taken into consideration the use of DLSS or RT for this discussion, as a way to have a more easy comparison on pure rasterization performance.**

**TLDR:** To me, Navi21 looks to be about 75% over the 5700XT, which would land it between the 3070 and 3080. If that is the case, I think that Nvidia will drop a 16GB 3070Ti (*or Super*) to directly compete with Big Navi. In what ways can AMD increase performance further, hopefully to match or pass the 3080 in performance?",Another Big Navi Performance Speculation Discussion,neither make post get lot attent care karma want get thought written discuss hate keep thing head rehash okay goe know xt chip mid rang chip would specul could offer bigger chip either cu possibl even cu power bigger chip would requir great launch ture would think cu chip would push w clock around ghz increas cu probabl would yield around improv perform assum memori bandwidth increas accommod improv linear perform improv cu chip would still lost ti around k assum ti faster k debat go assumpt discuss w would unaccept releas plu think want wast r money high end product mix architectur normal see perform improv high end gen gen year year cycl take consider use fp baselin math cu navi chip perform follow fp x fp theoret cu navi x fp x fp theoret cu navi fp would perform increas ti k perform also look line earli rumor far seen demo show perform better ti k assum test without dlss rt better ti catch beat think see rumor gb ti think wait announc big navi hit ti hope come littl magic get big navi perform equal would see rumor dual pipelin shader think sound similar fp x could wrong someon read pleas dive deeper els cu chip use hbm thought power target navi w far could go match taken consider use dlss rt discuss way easi comparison pure raster perform tldr navi look xt would land case think drop gb ti super directli compet big navi way increas perform hope match pass perform anoth big navi perform specul discuss

Amd,"We obviously don't have any real independent reviews and have to take Nvidia's word at this point. But even given their numbers, the only reason the price/performance looks so good is because of the absolute travesty the 20 series was. Something Nvidia of course fully admitted in the presentation. I'm almost surprised Jensen didn't call 20 series buyers suckers right there and then.

This is basically the launch that Nvidia owed us after last time and people are treating it as the greatest release in the history of computing.

People are also making posts worrying about whether AMD will be able to compete, but we haven't seen anything about RDNA 2 except what has been revealed with the consoles. I'd expect new info to come in the next few weeks if AMD has any sense and wants to steal any of the attention like Nvidia always does around AMD releases.

So what do we know about RDNA2 so far?

- Claimed 50% performance per watt improvement over RDNA1 (likely not calculated the way Nvidia seems to have done)
- They can produce a 52 (active) compute unit die that may outpace a 2080 at 1800 MHz and fits into the cost budget of a console
- They are using a variant of TSMC 7 nm. Dies should be much smaller than Nvidia (as seen with Xbox) and have a power efficiency advantage in terms of the node
- Clock speeds may reach over 2.2 GHz with good cooling, as seen in the PS5 within a console's power envelope
- Rumors suggest an 80 CU card
- Probably some stuff I'm missing

Based on Nvidia's pricing, it would seem they think AMD might have a competitor for the 3080, but not the 3090. I think that's plausible, but totally unconfirmed.

I understand the excitement of actually having decent products on the market, but I think it's best to wait until we have independent benchmarks before blindly declaring a winner. That's exactly what Nvidia is trying to get us to do right now, and it looks like it's working.

Edit: People completely misinterpreted the purpose of this post. I'm not telling people to wait for big Navi, especially the many die hard Nvidia fans among you. I've just noticed a massive uptick in posts along the lines of ""OMG these cards are amazing! AMD is doomed!""

We don't have real benchmarks yet. We don't even know what big Navi is.

Title.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; AM4 platform, best bang for buck under 300€ for all 3

His last build was AMD, and since AMD is in a particularly strong position these days, AM4 should be the obvious choice. But what is the best budget motherboard with decent features like 4 DIMM slots for the AM4 platform? What is the best value CPU for basic computing? I see 2666Mhz RAM is the most common supported frequency on cheap motherboards, does it make a noticeable difference compared to, say 3200Mhz or 3600Mhz? Also looking at 2x8Gb modules.

Budget is around 300€. Any help is appreciated!

You see, my computer is a mITX build, and my CPU is located right below my power supply. It pokes up *just* a bit too much, with the test fit. The classic Wraith had a clearance of a centimeter or so, so it's *very* close.

The case has a fan blowing from the front to the back, and the PSU is sucking air from the case (just above the CPU cooler) to the back. Would it be a terrible idea to take the fan off from the cooler, and use the existing case airflow to cool the 3700X? I was planning to run it at a 45W TDP anyway.

So I'm currently in my senior year and I am investing on a new coding/gaming PC for college, but since Nvidia announced the RTX 30 series at a sub-budget price that's gonna drop this month, I am constantly being told to wait for AMD's offerings or pre-order the 3070. My issue is that I need to have this thing soon in order to be more productive in my virtual classes and to esport in 120+ fps in 1080p (Overwatch, CS:GO, R6S, Melee on Dolphin, etc.) so the RX 580 and the RX 5500 are very tempting to me right now. The 580's advantage is that it's still going strong 3 years later with optimized drivers but the tech is slowly becoming obsolete. The 5500's advantage is that it's based on Navi and it has newer tech, but the drivers aren't optimized as well as the 580. The 5500 seems like a steal at $180 (counting newegg's rebate) while the 580 spiked up at $200. My deadline for this thing is on my birthday (9/20) and If I'm gonna get this thing, I need to order it now since the USPS is being intentionally delayed. What would be the best card for my needs?

EDIT 1: Both of the cards are 8GB, I don't need it like immediately but I don't want to wait past my birthday to build something just because a new GPU came out, the CPU I picked does not have integrated graphics.","I need something right now, should I get a $200 RX 580 or a $180 RX 5500 XT",repost sinc bot remov origin post current senior year invest new code game pc colleg sinc announc rtx seri sub budget price gonna drop month constantli told wait offer pre order issu need thing soon order product virtual class esport fp p overwatch cs go r mele dolphin etc rx rx tempt right advantag still go strong year later optim driver tech slowli becom obsolet advantag base navi newer tech driver optim well seem like steal count newegg rebat spike deadlin thing birthday gonna get thing need order sinc usp intent delay would best card need edit card gb need like immedi want wait past birthday build someth new came pick integr graphic need someth right get rx rx xt

Amd,"After Nvidia's RTX 3000-series event I'm seeing a lot of people immediately jumping to making GPU purchasing decisions.


The only reasonable answer to these sort of questions is as follows:

&gt; Don't make a purchasing decision before there are independent reviews and benchmarks for the graphics card you are considering.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally if your current graphics card is good enough for what you need it to do then it makes a lot of sense to wait and see how RDNA 2 turns out.
&gt;
&gt; Even if you already made a decision to not buy an AMD graphics card, deciding to buy a graphics card when there are no independent reviews is simply foolish and you don't need to look far back to know that even with Nvidia's products there is a risk to being an early adopter which became apparent [when some RTX 2080 Ti cards started failing not long after release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIRfPlC15uc).

The closest candidates I've found are the Eluktronics RP-17 and the THINN-15, but with the option for no storage or memory installed, since the SSD that comes with it is not very good. The THINN-15 seems really close, but reviews indicate that the build quality is flimsy despite being a magnesium alloy chassis.

Amd,"Hey all,

So I'm doing my first AMD build next week, and I've just got the motherboard and ram in. PC Parts Picker said there were no compatibility issues, but I keep seeing posts around the internet stating that I might have a problem as soon as I enable DOCP.  


TL;DR at the top - Does the Asus TUF Gaming X570 have a known issue with causing boot errors when enabling DOCP?

Amd,"Hello reddit,

I recentrly put a waterblock on my vega 56 (vertical mount) and my temperatures are correct for :the gpu 40°the hbm 40°the vddc 55°the mvddc 58°And when i checked the hot spot i had 110° ! yesterday playing FFXV on ultra 1080p 60hz settings (gpu at 100%)

Before that my temps were lower : 90-95° MAX on the hotspot with gpu and hbm temp at 70-80° with gpu at 100% use

If you guys can share your experiences with me i will be very happy because i don't really understand why it's so hot...

(according to amd there is many sensors inside the gpu at different location and the hotspot is the sensor with the highest temp recorded)

Some people say the hotspot junction on vega 56 is 125°And for the info AMD reported that for the 5700xt the hotspot junction is at 110°

So my question is : how can i cool this damn hotspot ? i didn't notice anything weird since i was playing like throttling or any other issues but i feel 110° is a bit too high since with the blower i had only 95° MAX and may not be good for the card life

I am using undervolt 1080mv a little hbm oc and power limit at +50 but this is not the problem since i had this undervolt on my old blower and even without oc when the card is on stock the hotspot will get 90°+ and me i will get 10-20 FPS less which is not a solution too

Amd,"Since updating to the most recent Windows build, I noticed quite a lot of stuttering. Very small microstutters and from monitoring FPS and frequency, had nothing to do with the card. My FPS would be a perfect 60 frames but still stutter. I had found enhanced sync or vsync off with radeon chill min/max set to my monitors refresh rate gave me very consistent frames but I could feel and see stuttering still. After doing some research, it seems that the problem was either 1. fullscreen optimization or 2. game mode. Disabling both gave me the best results. So far, I've tested this in Witcher 3, Insurgency Sandstorm, and Metro Exodus at 4k. The micro stutters are completely removed now. Sucks having to go into each exe file and turning off fullscreen optimization but it seems to be an old issue with posts from last year recommending you turn it off for every game.

Amd,"I am using ryzen master to test overclocking potential.
It currently seems stable at 4.1ghz + 1.3v (i tried 4.2ghz + 1.4v and system doesn't like it on load, don't think it's worth it increase voltage any higher).
I've ran prime95 blend test for an hour while using the computer; web surfing and youtube, and all is it is good, i thought I was in the clear.
However, later in the evening, I started a game (half life alyx) and system crashed within 5 mins.


I'm wondering if amd cpu is sensitive to power supply output. From what I've read, there's voltage regulation on mobo should be good. For reference, I'm using an old corsair hx520w (it's a rebranded seasonic) and I've used it on my old i5-2500k overclocking up to 5ghz without issue, so I'm hoping/expecting the power supply to be an non-issue.
I'm running a rx580 and I should be well under psu wattage limit.


My main question really is, is overclocking on ryzen worth it?
Let's say I get it stable at 4.1ghz, it's 'only' 300mhz higher than base clock (taking the medium of 3.7 and 3.9ghz) and it's (assuming linear scale/gains) it's like a 7% increase in performance.
With the i5-2500k, it was a no brainer to overclock it because you can literally gain 1ghz+ increase with no effort, which is like a 30% increase.
So I'm taking a step back to think if it's worth it to stress my cpu with .1 voltage increase with a loss of voltage stepdown all for a measly 300mhz/7% increase.","Overclocking r5 2600, stable but not stable",use ryzen master test overclock potenti current seem stabl ghz v tri ghz v system like load think worth increas voltag higher ran prime blend test hour use comput web surf youtub good thought clear howev later even start game half life alyx system crash within min wonder sensit power suppli output read voltag regul mobo good refer use old corsair hx w rebrand season use old k overclock ghz without issu hope expect power suppli non issu run rx well psu wattag limit main question realli overclock ryzen worth let say get stabl ghz mhz higher base clock take medium ghz assum linear scale gain like increas perform k brainer overclock liter gain ghz increas effort like increas take step back think worth stress voltag increas loss voltag stepdown measli mhz increas overclock r stabl stabl

I bought the Asus A15 with Ryzen 5 4600H and GTX 1650ti. So far I am impressed with its performance. Booting in under 5 seconds, great performance in games like GTA V, Star Wars Battlefront II or Battlefield V, great sounding speakers, cool aesthetics, etc.

I am really happy with my purchase overall, won't deny it. But I do get temps up to 95 on the CPU when playing.

I am not getting throtles (I think?) and I read from AMD that the actual chip's max temp is 105, so I don't think it will fry it. But still really high and it worries me.

Is this temp really so bad? Should I return the laptop? Or is this temp acceptable in the long run?

I undervolted my GPU gaining some extra 7fps in high settings in games like Shadow of the Tomb Rider, and lowering the power input, but CPU remains unaltered.

Will this issue with the heating fry the CPU in under 5 years? Will this shorten lifespan drastically? What are the real consequences of this?

I don't want to turn off turbo boost, it's like castrating an increidbly capable CPU. 

Returning it would be a pain in the ass for sure, and I would have to spend extra money to get an Intel/GTX 1660ti combo. But it's still possible for a week. 

I bought this because the price difference between 1650ti and 1660ti in my country is over 500 dollars, and the rest of the laptops in the market at my budget have a sub par Intel i5 and GTX 1650.

Some context: After years with a crappy PC I finally managed to save some money and buy all the components to assemble a new one
(Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB 3200Mhz, Asus Tuf Gaming B550-Plus, 250GB SSD NVMe and 600W PSU) just in time before my old one died. I bought everything and assembled it but I didn't had enough money to buy the GPU (RX 5700XT) so I had to wait for today to buy it, In the meantime I'm using my old RX460 to have at least a web browsing machine. 

Now, you all know that yesterday Nvidia presented the new 3070 with all that bang for the buck, I knew that the new RTXs and BigNavi were going to be announced but i thought they would just be slightly increase for a lot of money, basically I thought I couldn't afford either of them at launch, also because of availability.

What should I do? I now have 440€, just enough to buy the RX 5700XT, but since the RX 460 is still working (for web browsing basically) should I wait and keep saving money for two (or more) months to buy the RTX 3070? Or should I wait in hope that AMD launches BigNavi cards and buy em or the RX 5700XT if they cut prices?

I should also mention that I'm trying to get into Linux, so I prefer AMD's cards for their open source drivers.

Will existing B550 or X570 be fully compatible with this RTX IO? I have gotten confused with someone mentioning that boards are not fully compatible unless they have Gen 4.0 Re-Driver &amp; Gen 4.0 Switches.

Amd,"Intel will unveil their Tiger Lake CPU in just a few minutes. According to the leaked blueprint of the presentation, their top of the line SKU will go head to head against Ryzen 4800u. The most striking content of the presentation for me is the use of 'unconventional' benchmarking softwares (we're talking about Office softwares, even compression using Windows File Explorer) and the supposedly higher marks on gaming using Xe-LP graphics.  


I think this is the reason why AMD opted for Vega cores on the current line-up of their mobile processors. At least with Vega on 4000 series, they have 2 generations of mature GPU cores to be bundled to future processors.

Amd,"Intel recently patched the workaround people were using to avoid the crippled AMD functions. 

I did some quick benchmarking to [prove the workaround no longer works](https://imgur.com/a/BXbEwtm). 

Generally, I see a straight up loss of 15-20% performance, due to Intel intentionally crippling software on AMD CPUs. (Other people have claimed much higher losses in other workloads.)

I want to know if AMD is ever going to comment on this issue? This is extremely serious for people doing scientific and computational work on AMD.

Amd,"Hello, I thought I'd just share my recent experience of filling up my DIMM slots on Zen 2, but before going into that, I'll list my specs:

* R7 3800X 
* G.Skill Flare X (3200 MHz CL 14)
* Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master
* RTX 2080
* 1TB 970 EVO
* 1TB 860 EVO
* H115i Corsair
* Creative Zx Soundcard
* Seasonic Platinum 760 Watt PSU

Now, to start off with my RAM specifications, I managed to overclock all four DIMMs to 3800 MHz CL 16 with a DRAM Voltage of 1.45V and SOC of 1.1V. I did test for errors and came out safe on that front, so my setup is stable. As a side note for comparison, when dialing in my overclocking on my RAM, I ended up with the same profile with four DIMMs as I was running with two DIMMs. 

Now, this post isn't here to show off benchmarks or attempt to break any records, but rather I had a surprising relative performance uplift from filling out my DIMMs and gaining extra capacity. My FPS is all relatively the same across the board, which is honestly to be expected, but the biggest indication of difference to me is how much smoother everything is now.

For perspective, I often run multiple instances of just *things* at the same time. So, for example, emulators. I would sometimes have one running in the background while also either playing another game or doing some work-related tasks that deal mainly with compiling. Even without simultaneously running other programs though, the performance in the emulator itself is a lot smoother, which was a surprise to me. I no longer get small hitches when going between menus in whatever game is on the emulator, or get slight stutters in some animations. 

However, this isn't just an uplift for the emulators that I use, but just about any other program I use. Post-loading times are much faster now, and overall frame times appear to be a lot more stable - even in really old games like Company of Heroes 1 that I have running in DX9. As an example of loading times, I am currently building a mod for Company of Heroes 2, and the modding kit included with the game usually took some time to load into when opening an attribute file. Since this RAM change, my re-loading times have been cut down by upwards of around 20 seconds, which is just astonishing to me.

Now, to leave off, one thing I'm not sure about is if this performance uplift is because of filling out DIMMs as a relative operative thing special to Zen 2, or if just simply increasing the capacity allowed for the uplift. I've always heard the notion that 16GB was more than enough for a good experience, and while I guess that may be true, my system, while pretty smooth overall, wasn't exactly performing as flawlessly as I thought it should be - and this is in despite of me constantly looking for issues that might be fixable but coming up with nothing out of the ordinary. With 16GB, my in-use and cached capacity never got to critical levels of where I'd run out of capacity, so I didn't think adding more RAM would do much, but now that I'm on 32GB, while my in-use is pretty much the same, the cached memory easily exceeds the 16GB capacity threshold.",My experience with moving from 2x8GB (16GB) to 4x8GB (32GB) on a 3800X.,hello thought share recent experi fill dimm slot zen go list spec r x g skill flare x mhz cl gigabyt x aoru master rtx tb evo tb evo h corsair creativ zx soundcard season platinum watt psu start ram specif manag overclock four dimm mhz cl dram voltag v soc v test error came safe front setup stabl side note comparison dial overclock ram end profil four dimm run two dimm post show benchmark attempt break record rather surpris rel perform uplift fill dimm gain extra capac fp rel across board honestli expect biggest indic differ much smoother everyth perspect often run multipl instanc thing time exampl emul would sometim one run background also either play anoth game work relat task deal mainli compil even without simultan run program though perform emul lot smoother surpris longer get small hitch go menu whatev game emul get slight stutter anim howev uplift emul use program use post load time much faster overal frame time appear lot stabl even realli old game like compani hero run dx exampl load time current build mod compani hero mod kit includ game usual took time load open attribut file sinc ram chang load time cut upward around second astonish leav one thing sure perform uplift fill dimm rel oper thing special zen simpli increas capac allow uplift alway heard notion gb enough good experi guess may true system pretti smooth overal exactli perform flawlessli thought despit constantli look issu might fixabl come noth ordinari gb use cach capac never got critic level run capac think ad ram would much gb use pretti much cach memori easili exce gb capac threshold experi move x gb gb x gb gb x
Amd,"I'm running a Radeon VII, Ryzen 7 2700x, an MSI X470 motherboard and 32 GB of DDR4, G Skill brand.

Prior to upgrading I was running the same Radeon VII with a FX  8350, a Gigabyte 970 Gaming SLI motherboard and 32 GB of DDR3.

Prior to upgrading I had just downloaded Remnant from the ashes (it is the one and only game I'm now having trouble with) and put about 30 hours in flawlessly with 60 to 90 FPS on average on high settings.

After the upgrade... well you can see how it turned out in the video. Now whenever I turn the camera the GPU drops to almost 0% and FPS down to almost 0.

After a few days of research I've come to the conclusion that its either a bottle necking situation or something to due with my ram specifically. I ran the ""Windows Memory Diagnostic"" twice, once at default and once at deluxe.

The default came up with 0 problems and finished in about 10 minutes and didn't help the situation at all. However the deluxe run lasted over 3 hours (I fell asleep watching the screen after about 2 hours and when I woke up it was finished). Now the really  messed up part is after the deluxe program ran I tried to play the game and it worked flawlessly at ultra settings with 60 to 70 FPS with no drops. I played for about an hour with no issued then had to leave for work so I shut down my computer as I was going to be away from the house for almost 12 hours.

When I got back home excited that the issue was fixed, I found that I was back to square one. The game was back to being the way it is in the video. I really got into this game and played it a lot with my friends so I'd like to be able to play with them some more.

I am open to any suggestions that don't involve me spending more then 100$ lol.

Amd,"Ever since acquiring ATI and getting itself out of a nasty financial situation, AMD's management has set very measurable and conservative goals, understandably to satisfy shareholders. Intel just became complacent with its own success and underestimated just how aggressive AMD was on CPU front. AMD is focused on becoming an industry leader in CPUs. And perhaps, AMD doesn't actually plan to be a leader outside of the CPU market. My opinion is somewhat based on Lisa Su's statement in the reveal of Zen 2, where the largest focus went into trying to achieve 10-15% IPC for CPUs (and fortunately exceeding).
  
Nvidia has done some amazing breakthroughs in the last few years. DLSS, RTX and AI implementations show just how tight hardware and software integration has to be. I believe it’s simply because Nvidia's goals are different and they weren’t under the same pressure as Lisa Su. Nvidia has always strived to be first. It doesn't matter if the technology was mature, good or not, they had to be the first. That's why their marketing team is so cocky about RTX and DLSS, because they’ve hit the jackpot seemingly twice in a row.
  
I think AMD could benefit from freeing up their Radeon team from the shackles of their shareholders. Let Radeon have its own CEO, let them set their own targets and just funnel them the resources. AMD can still be the parent company.

Amd,"Hello

I just wanted to share my custom water cooling setup for my Powercolor 5700xt 8GBD6-3DH, since I believe that like me, most of you don't want to spend 100€/150$ for a one time gpu dedicated water block.

Basically I've used a couple of old stuff I've had like a simple mobo chipset waterblock, which I've used also in the past for cooling other GPU's I've owned, added a few heatsinks on the VRAM other on the VDDC, added an AMD Wraith Stealth cooler fan, a small M2 screw, rubber band (MacGyver style) and I was good to go!

[The disassembly...](https://preview.redd.it/j12egmnsdjk51.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fc68c1c19bedd3201635278162317fc07ae796f)

To channel the airflow I've made a cardboard air deflector so the cooler fan didn't spread the air randomly and ended up messing up the air flow of the case. This was it is pushed towards pci exhaust area.

Once tested and working properly, I've made a plexi one so that it doesn't ""hurt the eyes""... and used a MacGyver style rubber band just to keep the fan pointed and tilted as it should, while it helps to secure the plexi.

The temperatures decreased greatly, it runs at **full boost speed all-the-time** and there is no noise.

I hope this helps someone, and any ideas to improve it are more than welcome.

Not as pretty? Sure... but it keeps things running great and cool.

Amd,"If we had a CPU and an APU, with the exact same specs, same architecture, same speed, same cores, same cache, same TDP, same everything but the fact one has an iGPU and the other doesn't, and the iGPU were exactly as powerful as the dGPU, same FPS, same 2D and 3D processing power, and if no overclock were to be applied to either, having them running always at stock, would there be no difference in performance?

Would the CPU perform better because it offloads all the graphical work to the dGPU instead of taking it all alone, or would the iGPU put no additional load/stress on the APU, thus running better because of the absence of the additional heat source inside the case?

Would one be able to sustain peak speeds for longer/shorter times in one or the other case?

Would the only difference be the additional heat and power consumption of the dGPU?

My PC shut down yesterday after about 2 hours of gameplay of Wasteland 3, today I opened the game again to track temperatures and this is what I tracked, it shut down the first time as soon as the GPU hit 86C, or at least that was the last number I saw.

Any recommendation on what I can do to improve temperatures?

Recommended hardware for the game is an RX480, and I lower the settings from High to Low with just a couple of degrees dropping, from 81-84 to 78-82

Case is a NZXT H510 with the 2 120mm fans pre installed, I considered this could be the main issue but I wanted a second opinion, normal temperature in the room is between 20-22 degrees.

Amd,"Hello and good morning all,

I have brought home a server which has been replaced and is a 3990X machine.

It has 1200mm of radiator dedicated to just the CPU alone for cooling.

I spent roughly 6 hours yesterday tweaking trying to get it over the 3.8ghz all core clock with vcore set at auto and never peaking 1.1v vcore. I settled around 3.725ghz all cores and my temps while running R20 never break 63'C.

Current specs are as follows:

CPU: AMD 3990X Threadripper

Mobo: Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Master rev1.0 with latest bios and chipset drivers

Mem: Corsair CMW128GX4M8C3200C16 Vengeance RBG Pro

SSD: 4TB 970 EVO Plus

GPU: MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Gaming X Trio 11GB

I have a 3950X as well and when I benched the two with the same 2080ti, I noticed that my 3950X benched almost 3K higher on 3DMark than my 3990X did. So I am trying to bridge the gap here. I also am not using Ryzen Master as I noticed it kept loosing other settings in the BIOS if the system failed a stability gut check with R20 and would have to keep re-applying them. So I am doing all the overclocking through the BIOS.

One last thing to note is I tried taking the CPU up to 4GHZ on all cores but no matter how high I took the vcore ""I went up to 1.4vcore"", once I hit the start button on R20 the system would shut down ""probably not enough power"".

I have an extensive Intel background in pushing / tweaking those CPU's more than I do Threadripper experience.

Thank you all in advance to whomever takes the time to respond to this thread!

EDIT:

Hello everyone,

I spent some time and I was able to get this 3990X to be comparable to my 3950X 'for gaming purposes!'

Amd,"I used to be 100% in AMD's corner.  The first GPU I ever bought for myself was a GTX 6800 Ultra, which I purchased specifically to power the game _Everquest 2._  Said game had had a beta which I had participated in, and one of the advertisement splashes at the front of the game was for Nvidia—""The way it's meant to be played.""  Fine, I told myself.  I'm going to give this game the best I can, because its 3d engine is obviously the worst ever.  In the end, however, Nvidia turned out to be the bad pick.  AMD cards ran _EQ2_ better, and I think they were also cheaper at the time.

That made me an AMD fan.  My next couple of cards were AMD, the last of which was a R9 290X which I went and slapped a pure copper waterblock onto.  I did this because the thing was loud, and because it ran extremely hot, and because it was sold clocked so high that it was impossible to overclock, and this made me worry about its lifespan.  I felt that AMD had taken to selling their hardware in a default configuration that pushed it as hard as a heavy overclock, as a strategy for maintaining some kind of competitiveness.

The thing failed on me after a couple of years.  I had no backup.  Shrug.  I was frustrated that my prediction had come true, so my next card was Nvidia again.  This was also about the time when I finally recognized that the kind of precision tweaking I often needed to do—particularly, providing ""compatibility bits"" so things like forced AA would actually work in games that didn't inherently support it—was, _de facto,_ only available through apps for Nvidia cards.

Now I'm looking at how the next gen is fixing to land on us.  The 3080 looks to be roughly 75% more powerful than the 2080 (depends on the game but this is a nicely conservative estimate).  I admit I'm not dissatisfied with this.  As it happens, this was roughly the amount of extra horsepower I had previously calculated would be needed to run _Skyrim_ in 4K60 with ENB, which is pretty much the advent I've been waiting for before finally playing that damn game for real.

But the 10GB thing sucks, plain and simple.  So my eyes are again on AMD.

I've invented my own very sloppy, thoroughly clueless method for guessing what kind of power AMD's new beast will deliver.  It's based on the use of [this chart](https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/xbox-series-x-vs-sony-ps5-graphics-performance-2.jpg), combined with the rudimentary fact that the Xbox uses 52 cores and AMD's un-elaborated GPU will use 80.

The end result of that simple comparison is that I'm expecting the AMD GPU to be 51% more powerful than a 2080.

So.  $700 gets you a card that's 75% more powerful than a 2080.  What about 51%?  On a bald 1:1 basis, that works out to almost exactly $600.  But, AMD being AMD, they won't charge Nvidia prices, so it's almost certainly going to be $500 or less.  Depends on how much VRAM.

I'm going to be honest about this: I want that 75% power advantage, because I think I need it to get a flat 60fps in the games that matter to me.  But I am not happy about 10GB.  I know it's going to lead to stutters during gameplay, as games which really wanted more will resort to trading assets when it's not the best time to do that.  _Microsoft Flight Simulator_ already demands more, and these GPUs aren't even out yet.  There will be more games that underscore this issue.

My prediction at this point is that AMD will announce whatever they're going to announce, probably within the next week, and they'll show up Nvidia for their bad decision to only announce a 10GB model in the ""hypothetically affordable"" bracket.  But is Nvidia sitting on a 20GB model already, against just such an advent?

I'd be perfectly happy if AMD gave me ample incentive to buy their products again, because Nvidia is a virulently anti-consumer company and I would very much prefer not having to reward them for that.

Soo!? Anyone have any clues for the next AMD GPU's?

Like nVidia's new Ampere lineup is impressive!!! Did everyone note that nVidia did not even display a Titian Ampere!? They probably have one ready just in case something more powerful GPU comes to public!?  But...

...AMD R&amp;D are probably working on various GPU prototypes!? ( Just like Intel most probably! )

Everyone is talking about Navi RDNA2 with 80CU but that does not mean there is some prototype with a Navi at 120CU!?

Besides that no one is taking about a probable and hypothetical  Vega3 and 128CU! on a new  lower node!? Oh! with a high TDP!? Just lets hope they don't forget to do Low TDP GPU's this time!? Like below 75Watts TDP!? Thanks!!! Because that's what about \~80% of PC users will be buying!?

AMD may even jump to Navi RDNA 3 if the wanted to if its development was good and ready!?

Amd,"I'm seeing kind of an equal amount of what I would generally say is foolhardy optimism about RDNA2 being able to compete with RTX 30 on performance. It is unreasonable to expect coming from an RX 5700 performing somewhere between a 1080 ti and a 2070 super to hope that AMD are going to be able to both close a 30% performance gap to the 2080 ti/RTX 3070 (allegedly) and compete with a 3080. NVIDIA's aggressive pricing still won't cover up that most people are not going to spend more than $600 on their gpus (that's most of/a whole PS5 depending on it's final price). AMD also is getting the benefit of developers optimizing nextgen games to AMD cards for consoles, which I would imagine gives them both a crazy amount of business and price to performance benefits when those games designed with a PS5 in mind are ported onto a PC.

Amd,"So I've noticed that I've been getting stuttering from my AMD pc's for close to two years since I first built a pc with a Ryzen 2600x, and just this past week bought a laptop that has a Ryzen 4800H and was still having the same issue (both Nvidia GPUs, 144hz monitors, G-sync capable).  I could never figure out what the issue was as I had tried nearly everything that you would find in forums searching google for answers.  I recently came across a post (that I conveniently now cannot locate) that mentions how having a speaker that only requires a 2.0 usb outlet being connected to a 3.0 outlet was giving a user stuttering issues.  In his case, it was a usb speaker.  In my case, it was a PS4 controller - PS4 controllers have a little speaker on them, so it was either this or the aux port on the bottom side of the controller itself that it's having a difficult time communicating with.  Low and behold, I tried playing with an Xbox One controller today (unplugging the DS4) and graphics were [smooth.as.silk](https://smooth.as.silk)!  No more terrible microstutters or choppiness anywhere!  I'm sure there's a way to disable the audio port on the PS4 controller and be able to use it that way, but I haven't played around with that yet.  I really got lucky with this because I definitely wouldn't have figured this out myself in a million years.

I'm just posting this to potentially help out even one person that may be at their wits end trying to figure out what's going on.

Edit: After playing a little bit more *some* of the stuttering returned (probably 25% what it was).  Since someone suggested adding in a sound card helped, I looked into the sound card settings and disabled **Hardware Acceleration** with the realtek audio device.

Amd,"I  recently upgraded from a i5 9400f/z370 to a r5 3600x/b550 it's really  just a side upgrade nothing major. The reason for upgrading was I needed  the extra 6 threads since my i5 was hitting 90-100% usage in my games  and was unable to properly record many games. Also AMD announced that  b450,x470,b550 and x570 motherboards will support the next generation of  ryzen zen 3 processors to give me an upgrade path.

I  have had more experience with intel in the past had an i7 920 build, i5  4570, i5 9400f,i7 6700, pentium g4560, pentium g5400, and i7 4770 where  as for amd I've only had a fx 8350 build, ryzen 2700 till I bent the  pins in a butterfingers situation while changing thermal paste and the  now 3600x cpu. So I've had my foot in both ball parks and here to give  an honest review of my new favorite cpu besides the i7 920 due to  nostalgia ;). Upon delivery of the 3600x I also received a Asrock b550m  steel legend board as well that I purchased from newegg. Installation  was fairly easy but when dealing with amd cpu's you can easily make a  mistake and bend a pin so be careful . I decided to use the wraith  cooler included as amd has been known to have much better in box coolers  than intel.

When I loaded in and  got my bios dealt with I tried enabling my ram X.M.P I originally  planned on reusing my rip.jaws ddr4 3600 cl18 ram with this build but  could not get it stable without manually oc'ing the ram to 2933mhz which  worked fine. I decided to say F it since I wasn't happy with the 2933  speed and installed a spare kit 16gbs of vengeance lpx 3200mhz cl16 into  the system then it worked fine at 3200mhz. I later saw that the  rip.jaws ram specifically said intel x.m.p 3600mhz so watch out with  your ram you choose as some brands use intel 2.0 xmp profiles which  don't work well with ryzen. After getting all that out of the way lets  get to the reason you came here how does it perform, how cool does it  run, and how much if any is it better than your previous 9400f.

To  start things off the 3600x scored a 130 single core score on  user-benchmark -(not a great source I know but the single core and multi  core benches are accurate)-while my i5 9400f can only manage 118 at  best so based upon that factor we should see technically a boost in  games that don't use more than 2-4 cores. The idel temps were 4-6  degrees higher than the 9400f and 10-11 degrees hotter while gaming but then again I used my old hyper 212 evo with the i5 as it was all i had on hand. Now to the juicy  bit the benchmarks in games.

I  tested a few games I felt were both gpu and cpu bound to give a fair  test. I benched gtav, csgo, far cry 5, Forza horizon 4, watch dogs 2,  left 4 dead 2, arma and vr titles like pavlov, blade and sorcery and  walking dead saints and sinners as I didn't want to test my entire steam  library as that would take to long as I own 182 games now with 14 being  free.

1. In  gtav at 1080p ultra with advanced settings off with a 2070 the avg for  the 3600x was 134 fps while the 9400f was 126 for the 1% lows the 3600x  saw 78fps and the i5 9400f saw 29fps.
2. For  csgo at competitive settings at 1080p the 3600x saw 255fps avg and the  9400f saw 173 fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 96 fps while the  9400f got 57 fps.
3. for  far cry 5 at 1080p high settings the 3600x saw an avg fps of 118 fps  while the 9400f saw 110 fps. for 1% lows the 3600x scored 45 fps while  the i5 9400f score 9 fps.
4. For  forza at 1080p ultra the 3600x saw 91 fps avg while the i5 9400f saw 87  fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 59 fps and the 9400f saw 23fps.
5. For  watch dogs 2 at medium 1080p the 3600x saw 88 fps avg and the 9400f saw  74fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 28fps and the 9400f scored 6  fps.
6. For  left 4 dead 2 at ultra 1080p the 3600x scored 289fps avg and the i5  9400f scored 216 fps avg. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 189 fps while the  9400f saw 76fps.
7. Arma  3 at medium settings at 1080p saw 104fps avg for the 3600x and 76 fps  avg for the i5. For 1% lows the 3600x saw 42fps while the i5 saw 39.
8. Now  it's time for vr. My particular headset has a 90hz refresh rate so we  are vr headset limited. In pavlov at ultra the 3600x saw 90fps locked at  avg while the 9400f stayed a consistent 82-83. For 1% lows the 3600x  saw 90fps and the 9400f saw 26fps.
9. For  blade and sorcery the 3600x was locked at 90fps for the avg and so was  the 9400f. For 1% lows the 3600x scored 79fps and the 9400f scored  37fps.
10. For  saints and sinners the 3600x saw 90fps locked for avg and the 9400f saw  87 avg. For 1% lows the 9400f scored 54 fps while the 3600x scored  75fps.
11. So  in conclusion the 3600x is a better cpu for gaming in general. The 3600x while not scoring a enormous lead on avg's the 1% lows where much better and experienced a more steady experience with more consistent frame timings making a more immersive experience. If you were to buy this cpu I recommend it only when it's on sale because it's usually 40-50 dollars more expensive than the 3600 for just 2-4 fps in games due to the 3600(x) coming stock  overclocked to +200mhz.",Honest review of r5 3600x for anyone considering buying.,recent upgrad f z r x b realli side upgrad noth major reason upgrad need extra thread sinc hit usag game unabl properli record mani game also announc b x b x motherboard support next gener ryzen zen processor give upgrad path experi intel past build f pentium g pentium g fx build ryzen till bent pin butterfing situat chang thermal past x foot ball park give honest review new favorit besid due nostalgia upon deliveri x also receiv asrock b steel legend board well purchas newegg instal fairli easi deal easili make mistak bend pin care decid use wraith cooler includ known much better box cooler intel load got bio dealt tri enabl ram x p origin plan reus rip jaw ddr cl ram build could get stabl without manual oc ing ram mhz work fine decid say f sinc happi speed instal spare kit gb vengeanc lpx mhz cl system work fine mhz later saw rip jaw ram specif said intel x p mhz watch ram choos brand use intel xmp profil work well ryzen get way let get reason came perform cool run much better previou f start thing x score singl core score user benchmark great sourc know singl core multi core bench accur f manag best base upon factor see technic boost game use core idel temp degre higher f degre hotter game use old hyper evo hand juici bit benchmark game test game felt bound give fair test bench gtav csgo far cri forza horizon watch dog left dead arma vr titl like pavlov blade sorceri walk dead saint sinner want test entir steam librari would take long game free gtav p ultra advanc set avg x fp f low x saw fp f saw fp csgo competit set p x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x score fp f got fp far cri p high set x saw avg fp fp f saw fp low x score fp f score fp forza p ultra x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x saw fp f saw fp watch dog medium p x saw fp avg f saw fp avg low x score fp f score fp left dead ultra p x score fp avg f score fp avg low x saw fp f saw fp arma medium set p saw fp avg x fp avg low x saw fp saw time vr particular headset hz refresh rate vr headset limit pavlov ultra x saw fp lock avg f stay consist low x saw fp f saw fp blade sorceri x lock fp avg f low x score fp f score fp saint sinner x saw fp lock avg f saw avg low f score fp x score fp conclus x better game gener x score enorm lead avg low much better experienc steadi experi consist frame time make immers experi buy recommend sale usual dollar expens fp game due x come stock overclock mhz honest review r x anyon consid buy

I'm not sure why it's not the non-X version, but otherwise I think this makes a lot of sense. Most tech journalists don't do this, they always seem to find ways to recommend Intel for more expensive builds, as they are (somewhat understandably) afraid of offending Intel fanboys.

Amd,"Hello there!

I got a 5700XT (Specifically a Thicc III Ultra). Performance wise I'm happy with it, but then I learned about Undervolting and temperatures, and wanted to try by myself. Now, I'm a Linux user and an undervolting noob, so I would appreciate any help

Here is the thing. I undervolted it to 1900Mhz@996mV which should be a pretty regular undervolt for what I've read. Thing is, when running the Fur benchmark, from GPUTest ([https://www.geeks3d.com/gputest/](https://www.geeks3d.com/gputest/)), on Linux, Memory load goes to 55% - 60% while on Windows 10, it doesn't seem to take more than a 6/7%. (Maybe there is an error on mem usage reporting?)

In any other benchmark I run from GPU Test, none of them load so much memory and I have the results I would expect from them, but in the case of the Fur, with the high memory usage, the power consumption goes to the limit and the junction temperature to 100º (And the GPU is not reaching the 1900Mhz@996mV because it's over the power consumption limit).

I personally think it's very likely AMD makes use of that to get a denser lineup.

Amd," 

I got a SKU with a 4500U, 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD. The machine feels and looks great, not super premium but definitely above its price. Display looks beautiful even though it's matte but the lower bezel could be smaller.

**Display**

As noted this is a matte display so reflections are almost non-existent. However, the 300 nit brightness leaves a lot to be desired in anything less than 90% brightness, the single biggest flaw on the machine. Colors look great though and viewing angles are what you'd expect from an IPS at this price.

**Performance**

The 4500U is a powerhouse for the TDP at 25W even without SMT. It's way too snappy for most of the things I do as a law student such as web browsing, doc writing and media consumption. However, when I want to use that 4 GHz boost it's reliable and seamless. For anyone interested, it scored a 2387 in Cinebench R20, an impressive score for a slim 25W ultrabook. Memory is fast but I really do not recommend 8 GB anymore as Windows takes a heavy chunk of that even when disabling non-critical processes.

As for the integrated graphics, I tried two titles which aren't the most demanding out there. Medieval Total War 2 got me a solid 60+ FPS at highest settings but I locked it (insert The Verge reference here) to keep temps lower. Also tried GTA V on High/medium and got about 45 FPS which was definitely playable but not that nice to watch. Now as far as temps are concerned, it's a mixed bag. The CPU package skyrockets to 101 degrees when gaming without fps limiters on and during more demanding titles. Fans kick in a bit too late but afterward they can keep the package at about 80 degrees and lower long term which I find acceptable for such a slim machine.

**Keyboard and touchpad**

Now coming from a 15,6 Acer thiccboi I was used to a hefty amount of real estate. Keys feel good to click but are shallow as you would expect. It does feel kind of cramped for an average sized male but you get used to it. Some key placements are quite annoying but this is also a Scandinavian keyboard which adds three letters. Caps lock button is way too big and up-and-down keys are way too small, love the FN keys for their utility though. Keyboard backlight has 3 levels but the lit options look the same and it does get bright.

Touchpad has an acceptable size for the form factor and feels smooth and every gesture works as you'd want, not much to add here.

**Battery Life**

The battery life has impressed me. The 61 Wh cell is decently sized and I've got about 10 hours of active use. This is mostly with full brightness and keyboard lighting off but with the power slider at the second option and Lenovo's Intelligent cooling. My rationale is that the CPU is fast enough to be run at low wattage and clocks, especially for most of my use cases.

**Other aspects**

Sound is great with the two front-firing speakers, a joy while streaming music or videos. The Windows Hello IR is good but not as reliable as a fingerprint reader and the web camera itself is average. Temps and fans during light usage are great pros of the device, temps are low at about 45 degrees and fans are completely quiet. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are extremely solid with the Wi-Fi 6 Intel chip, no issues encountered whatsoever.

**Conclusion**

I love this machine and its value proposition which is a lot better compared to the usual Macbook Air students like to pick up here in Sweden (dual core in 2020, come on). Build, performance and battery life are the biggest pros while the biggest con is by far the low display brightness.

I don't have a fancy Freesync monitor, just a 60Hz 1080p one, and a Radeon RX 5600 XT, I got the card after selling off my PS4.

The input lag is **atrocious**, on COD Warzone, for instance, with an Xbox One controller the experience is awful, is this supposed to be normal?  Turning Vsync off looks terrible, I don't get it, the PS4 has extremely low input lag, and is a much inferior piece of hardware, TV included.

Amd,"So I sold my gaming desktop's 2080ti in anticipation their prices would fall with new releases coming up.   Bought three 5xxx series cards, with the nicest (XFX thicc III ultra) going in my desktop.  My system had been VERY stable prior to the AMD switch, I was careful and used DDU in safe mode to switch drivers.   I updated my motherboard and chipset drivers, I updated to the latest AMD video drivers....

And it's *almost* stable enough to accept.. but a few green screens in MSFS, and overnight random restarts while mining convinced me I need to return this card before the return window expires.

It's a shame.   I REALLY wanted to like this card.   I'm honestly unreasonably attached to the idea of having an AMD GPU with my 3900X.....  but the stability just isn't there.   I even replaced my PSU with a better 1000W version in hopes of stabilizing things... but no.

It will work fine for days... and then suddenly have a ""moody"" day where it restarts my machine 3 or 4 times.   I just can't.

Sorry AMD.  I'll check back in with you soon to see how your drivers and stability are doing.   I really want team green to have solid competition!

The XT release didn't help either. I wanted to just stop there and get an XT processor if reviews were positive but we all know how that turned out. That was a tough time. I was like ""AMD focus on Zen 3 please"".

Cooling: open loop with 3 240 rads, both CPU and GPU are on the same loop

PSU: thermaltake toughpower grand rgb 850

Tweaks:

RAM AND IF: I tweaked the RAM UP to 3733 and have it at 1.39V (it might go lower voltage wise but this seemed to boot well so I can play with it more later). I then set the fclk to 1867 to couple it with the RAM speed

CPU: I turned PBO on with a 5x scalar, set 200mHz offset

Characteristics of tweaks: It gamed while streaming 1080p 60 fps for a few hours the other night with no hitches. Right now cinebench score is about 7230 or so with chrome open and lot of apps like discord running in the background (not great but not terrible, I will figure out how to shut down all background apps for a more reliable score soon). It passes intel burn test on High, but only hit 9 outputs on very high and 2 on maximum. My peak single core clock seems just shy of 4.4 GHz, I have never seen a single core reach 4.6. I am currently running prime95 large fft to test that the memory overclock is stable.

How to get better single core clocks? Not that the CPU is performing particularly bad per se but it would be nice to actually see 4.6 at some point.

Intel Burn test does not crash and temps never exceeds 75 deg (Ryzen master) but it still says system not stable at max and very high. I don't think it is cooling. Would fclk cause this? Anything I can do to improve stability?

Is there a direct test to ensure fclk is stable?

Amd,"Dlss and rt performance is likely to distort the actual performance of the new gpu's and thus oversell their capability in older/current titles. Having the results in the review is fine, but the tests should also be run WITHOUT the performance enhancers too and then judged based on the without results.

Additionally, can we get avg power/frequency graphs in the reviews for each game? A Battlefield game is much more taxing than Rocket League on a per frame basis and these big GPU's are likely going to boost higher in RL than BF because they will hit thermal/power limits before hitting freq limit in BF... that's useful info that is generally not available outside of youtube videos with afterburner running from sketchy channels.",Can we get commitments from reviewers to not use dlss/amd equiv techs in their reviews as the basis for their recommendations?,dlss rt perform like distort actual perform new thu oversel capabl older current titl result review fine test also run without perform enhanc judg base without result addit get avg power frequenc graph review game battlefield game much tax rocket leagu per frame basi big like go boost higher rl bf hit thermal power limit hit freq limit bf use info gener avail outsid youtub video afterburn run sketchi channel get commit review use dlss equiv tech review basi recommend

Amd,"Yesterday I updated my father-in-law's Ryzen 2400G PC, which I bought for him 2-3 years ago, and hasn't had any drivers updated since, and hardly any Windows updates (because it turned out that the old AMD raid drivers conflicted with newer Windows 10 versions).

As part of this, I updated the GPU drivers, and was stuck by how much worse the 20.8.3 drivers look compared to 17.12, taking a lot more screen space with hard to navigate panels full of what feels like irrelevant info in colours that are hard to distinguish.

I've been an AMD/ATI user for a long time, and it feels to me like drivers just grow worse and worse over time. I prefer a functional look, and I realise that the visual design language of computers have grown in some parts to make it harder to get at actual content (like websites with large images and text where you have to scroll pages to read a few words), but I feel it'd be much better to have something streamlined, clear and informative.

It's probably supposed to appeal more to gamers, which are the main buyers of GPUs, and perhaps it does appeal to heavy gamers to have gaming stats and suggestions. I don't know. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, but it would really be nice if I could just have functionality up front instead of irrelevant info.",GPU driver UI has gone worse over time,yesterday updat father law ryzen g pc bought year ago driver updat sinc hardli window updat turn old raid driver conflict newer window version part updat driver stuck much wors driver look compar take lot screen space hard navig panel full feel like irrelev info colour hard distinguish ati user long time feel like driver grow wors wors time prefer function look realis visual design languag comput grown part make harder get actual content like websit larg imag text scroll page read word feel much better someth streamlin clear inform probabl suppos appeal gamer main buyer gpu perhap appeal heavi gamer game stat suggest know perhap old would realli nice could function front instead irrelev info driver ui gone wors time
Amd,"A lot of people are under the assumption that the reason why RTG is so quiet is because they've got something that can actually give Nvidia a run for their money. But they want Nvidia to show their hand first. This is wrong because if they've got something good they should have been screaming from the rooftops not to buy ampere. They knew Ryzen 1000 was going to shake up the market and we had shit ton of ""controlled leaks"". Ryzen 3000 was basically the same, Zen 2 was pretty much going to dethrone Intel and they were quite vocal about that too. But I'm not seeing that behavior in regards to their next gen gpus.   
  
  
So on the other hand some folks are saying they don't have anything that can compete with the likes of the RTX 3080 or 3090. And instead of over hyping a disappointing product, they'll release it without much fuss and call it a day. As they've learned from their past experiences like with Vega. (poor volta anyone?)  
  
If you think about it, almost all the information we've gotten regarding RDNA2 has come from Microsoft and Sony for their upcoming consoles. The Xbox series X and playstation 5. Apart from some info we heard in some conferences quarterly calls, not much information was given to us directly.  
  
The main reason being amd don't care about desktop graphics. This is really just a small side gig for them when they have other major markets that will bring them in a lot More revenue. Right now they're dominating the diy space with Ryzen 3000, and they'll literally delete Intel once Zen 3 comes out. Manufacturers transition happens slowly in the datacenter space, but we know that Rome absolutely crushes intel Xeon, and Milan is going to spread them blue cheeks absolutely nail them so hard where they never thought possible.  
  
RTG is going to make crap ton of money from the consoles. They've also got more laptops moving with the Ryzen 4000 mobile cpus. They just don't care about desktop graphics because they know Nvidia is going to beat them. And instead of properly trying to compete with them, they've actually joined them in this cozy hot tub of inflated gpu prices. Just look at the 5700XT series. These were supposed to be the direct replacement for the RX 480 and 470. But instead of delivering them at that 200-250 sweet spot category, they're like nah let's over price our gpus like Nvidia did. Because who cares about desktop graphics.  
   
So with big navi, regardless of even if they have good products to compete. It doesn't matter because they're just going to join Nvidia in whatever pricing scheme that they're going to use to take advantage of the consumers with. Once they know Nvidia's prices, they'll be like ""alright here's a similar perfoming card for $50 cheaper, maybe buy us, maybe dont? We don't care because we're focused on other shit."" 
 
So if you were wondering why AMD has been so quiet, there's your answer. Its because it's one of the last thing that's on their minds. If RTG was actually serious we would have definitely seen something by now. Something to deter or distract the userbase or prospective buyers from their marketing campaign. But nope, they just quietly sat by and counted down with Nvidia. 
 
Come release time for big navi, they'll release it. It won't be all that special, pricing will be barely better than nvidia, but who cares. Their die hard fans will buy them, and they'll continue to focus on the other markets that's more important to them.","AMD's silence is being misunderstood.

Amd,"Hi Guys, I'm posting this as sorta Review of AMD's RMA Service, but also as a Discussion too!

Since I bought my 3900X Back in Sept. 2019, I've had this boot up error '8d"". would happen about 80% of the time on a cold boot after the system had been off for more than say 6-8 Hours! Now, other than this Error, The system has been running Great!

Now as for things I've tried to fix the Issue I can say I've tried Every suggest I could find on here and other Tech forum site to no avail! This ""8d"" isn't even listed in either of my Motherboard Manuals.  I've tweaked Bios Setting for the Ram, V core and SOC. I've literally switched out Ram and GPU's and Even tried a Different Motherboard. I've also, since Sept. of last year, updated the Bios like 4-5 times hoping one of those would fix it.... Nope,still gets stuck on 8d.

I've seen others post about the Issue and it's almost always a Ryzen 3000 series CPU. Since the only thing I haven't switched out is the CPU, so I went a Bought a 3800X and it's been about 2 Months, and NO 8d error!!

So I decided to Contact AMD support a Month ago and Request an RMA on my CPU for what I believe is a Bad Memory Controller. (Assuming this based on ""Ram"" debug LED is on when Boots to 8d)

After a Few back a forth email from them making sure I tried... Bla, Bla, Bla! You know how Customer Service is! LOL!  I was authorized to return the CPU for Verification testing. 2 weeks ago, I received Email confirmation that the CPU was defective (no Details on exactly what was the defect) and they were sending me out a Replacement! I was like, O-k-a-y...

So, I guess what I'm asking is, Did AMD just confirm that the ""8d' Post code is a Memory Controller issue??

Has anyone else with this Issue tried to RMA their CPU?

Also should note that the replacement CPU was a Brand New, still sealed in the Retail Box, 3900X!! I thought for sure that even if they replaced My old 3900X, it would be a tray CPU only in the plastic holder. Bit of a Shocker, but Happy to see AMD honoring there Warranties to the Max!

I wanted to post this to Hopefully help others that have been having this Issue.

Amd,"Am I doing this right?

First time building a server-like computer and I have gotten excited about the 2nd Gen EPYC line! I read a number of posts ([e.g. this forum](https://forum.level1techs.com/t/threadripper-build-for-relion-cryo-em-protein-resolving/141100), [WarpEM hardware recommendations](http://www.warpem.com/warp/?page_id=65), along with builds offered by industry vendors) to get a sense of balance between investing in RAM, GPU, and CPU for a Cryo-EM application, though I have a lot to learn here. Most vendors opt for Xeon-builds, but they do not optimize for value-driven performance. Ultimately, I landed on an EPYC-based build with a pair of RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.

I had originally looked into the [Gen 3 Threadripper](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Rp44yk) but was leary of the lack of buffered-ECC RAM and general gaming-tilt. Ideally a workstation/server like this will scale-up for future Lab builds and the Threadripper-compatible motherboards don't tend to scale beyond 3-GPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

Outstanding questions:

1. Does it make sense to hold out for an ATX Supermicro H12 motherboard?
2. [EPYC 7402](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7402) selected based on number of cores &amp; [price/core](https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AMD-EPYC-7Fx2-Launch-SKUs-Value-Analysis-Cost-Per-Core.jpg) (although the higher clock speeds for the  [EPYC™ 7F72](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7f72) are appealing), is this a miserly choice?
3. [Cooling](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3604-best-gaming-pc-cases-for-airflow-in-2020-right-now)\- For home-use I love the Fractal Define series, but here I'm hedging on cooling needs and am looking at their Meshify case, or the bequiet Dark Base (need to verify volume accommodations). Is air-cooling sufficient, should the case be purposefully over-sized for better active/passive cooling?
4. I believe I can get an academic discount for an NVIDIA GPU (\~20%), such as the [Titan RTX](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-Titan-RTX-vs-Nvidia-RTX-2080-Ti/m664199vs4027) or [Quadro RTX 5/6k](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-vs-Nvidia-Quadro-RTX-5000/4026vsm712800) but the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti units come in at such a high-value it would be hard to pass up. (Perhaps this is why they're surprisingly difficult to source at the moment). Many industry builds cite higher-end cards like the [P100](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tesla/pdf/Molecular-Dynamics-Oct-2017-MB-slides.pdf) but they are so far outside of my price range I get the impression consumer-end cards are the right direction.
5. I hope registered ECC RAM is worth the expense here, along with the 2133 vs. 3600 Mhz hit.
6. Any critical accessories (aside from a nice [32"" ISP monitor](https://www.asus.com/us/Monitors/ProArt-PA32UC/) and peripherals) to consider?

Minor vent:

I had some vendors preach about warranty and liability which rubbed me the wrong way; I would love to spend more on the components and less on mark-up, as this is on an academic grant but can appreciate the value of offloading IT headaches.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" A lot of those parts to include CPU and memory, only come with a 1 year manufacturer’s warranty. If these GPU systems aren’t designed and supported by a company with expertise, then you can run into heat issue which will fry your parts. In that case, as failures come up you are juggling individual warranty issues with different manufacturers, which I guarantee would not be a fun experience. If warranty is short, you risk the additional costs to bring in new parts and the down time from research computing associated with that. With a system from us, we warrant the entire system and as support issues come up we respond and replace parts quickly minimizing downtime.   
&gt;  
&gt;To me it is a no brainer and huge value, but what do I know. ;-)  ""

Amd,"Nvidia seem to be ramping things up into full swing, with their upcoming event on September 1st that will hopefully give us all of the details about Ampere. In the meantime, we've also had leaks pertaining to the cooler, power delivery, memory configuration and expected performance of the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

What do we actually have from Big Navi? I'm sure I read that it is meant to launch before the next gen consoles, also utilising RDNA2, but aside from that I'm hard pressed to find anything. Is there even a scheduled event from AMD to reveal more?

It feels totally dead right now, whereas for Nvidia it's actually becoming quite an exciting time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm desperate for more details as I'm sure many are, but in the meantime Nvidia are building hype and public interest already. I'm a bit concerned that if we don't see something soon then basically people that have been waiting patiently to upgrade their GPUs might just switch over to Nvidia since they'll have their lineup, pricing information and will more than likely release first.

Amd,"So, I have a RX 580 that I bought in 2017. I am not a graphics stickler since I've played games on minimum requirements(Intel HD FTW), my entire life, before 2017. The last few years have been nice. However, I'm in no rush to upgrade as I still get decent framerates. So, here is the question. Assuming no hardware problems, how long do you think the RX 580(8 GB) will be able to run games as a minimum system requirement?

Hey everyone, this is going to be my first build and I was wondering what cooling is necessary. I am not overclocking, but I will be gaming and rendering video, effects, etc. I know Noctua NH-D15 gets a lot of praise despite how ugly the default colors look. I am wondering if a cooler that big is overkill? Like would I ***need*** that much of a cooler or one similar like the dark rock pro 4 or others. For me, Noctua is frustrating because I want the cooler and the reputation, but I don't want the brown fans. Trying to find the right black fans to replace smaller coolers is a pain. But I wonder if it is worth it.

I would be spending more money for the looks to get let's say a Noctua NH-D15S or even a base D15 rather than just going with the new black and replacing the fans. Is the D15S even too much for a general gaming/video rendering/work/internet surfing machine? I know the wraith actually works fairly well given it is stock, but I want a bit better of an air cooler without going AIO.

Does anyone have any insight? Yes, I know case, mesh front, and case fans all temperatures all factor into the overall temp, but I am talking more in general. I see a lot of people in the comments and other places recommending the D15, but I don't know if they are overclocking or what exactly to justify that big ass cooler.

If anyone knows what fans to buy for replacement for other Noctua models, then I am all ears. Also, I am open to suggestions for other air coolers. I find ones I like, but they get not so stellar reviews. I will buy standard or ARGB if it is the right one.

Any help would be appreciated!",Air cooler for a 3900X?,hey everyon go first build wonder cool necessari overclock game render video effect etc know noctua nh get lot prais despit ugli default color look wonder cooler big overkil like would need much cooler one similar like dark rock pro other noctua frustrat want cooler reput want brown fan tri find right black fan replac smaller cooler pain wonder worth would spend money look get let say noctua nh even base rather go new black replac fan even much gener game video render work internet surf machin know wraith actual work fairli well given stock want bit better air cooler without go aio anyon insight ye know case mesh front case fan temperatur factor overal temp talk gener see lot peopl comment place recommend know overclock exactli justifi big ass cooler anyon know fan buy replac noctua model ear also open suggest air cooler find one like get stellar review buy standard argb right one help would appreci air cooler x
